"Cutting what he wants in 3 years would literally make many agencies disappear overnight. Not only does it ignore realpolitik (aka impossible to do) its not.. .well.. sane. Cutting income tax would cut a massive portion of the government revenue and force very extreme cuts almost instantly. This is very similar to what pinochet did with Chili. While it will cause an economic boom in the long run it will also cost years of depression. The Pinochet plan is widely criticized even by Milton Friedman for being too much too fast. Extreme change on an economy without allowing time for the market to gradually adapt has a very steep price.

&gt;Your country cannot afford to go to war, it will bankrupt you and most likely cause a MASSIVE depression,

None of this is grounded in reason. The military budget is totally in tune, and even historically low as a % of GDP. The military isn't the problem and thus war with Iran wouldn't be either. The biggest issue right now fiscally is Medicare. That's where our revenue is going. If you want to talk fiscal conservatism though having a nuclear Iran hold the Gulf hostage, and thus where we get our oil, is far from a fiscally sound choice.

&gt; it will bankrupt you

The U.S. can't go bankrupt. It's not possible. All of its debt is held in its own currency and it can print to pay if need be.

&gt;cause a MASSIVE depression

Printing money to pay the debt would lower the value of the debt as well as pay it off. Inflation works against debt holders. This would not cause a depression it all but rather it would risk stagflation as seen in the 70's. High inflation rates aren't a good thing really but depressions are traditionally caused by a shortage in money supply and not an increase.

&gt;and they are asking YOU for bailouts, when you already owe China Billions of dollars.

Europe is really asking Germany for bailouts and to some extent Russia and the US. The vast majority of US debt is held by the US government - not China. China has a sizable chunk of debt but this is honestly a scare tactic. Fear of China causes fear of debt when its really unfounded. If we were to start paying down the debt paying it all off would be stupid. We want low interest debt as it causes growth and by proxy increased revenue. On top of this with debt comes the dollar being used as the staple currency around the world. People trading in dollars is a good thing for US interests.

"Norquist's pledge is a pledge to never, under any circumstances, raise income tax rates. Or to remove any ""loophole"" that would have the effect of raising income tax revenue without introducing some other loophole that would offset it dollar for dollar.

Why would not being OK with that hardline rule have any effect on what I would think of lowering a tax rate (other than doing so without removing the rule would mean the lower tax rate would be what we're stuck with even if it didn't have the effect we were looking for)? Not having the pledge in place does not mean wanting everyone to swear to raise all taxes nor does it mean I would be against lowering taxes where appropriate, it means I don't want my representatives removing an option from the table even when that option is the only fiscally responsible one.

Similarly, I would be against a pledge to never, ever go to war. I don't want to go to war but I certainly don't want people who would never consider the option.

I've explained twice now how Norquist's pledge is no good when paying for something like a war, which is a *temporary* massive expenditure and you've just wandered off into social programs each time. Why? The only possible point you can be trying to make with that that I can see is that Norquist's pledge discourages doing long term massive expenditures that are not already paid for and that's not what I'm arguing Norquist's pledge is not good for. 

And raising taxes on the middle class is exactly what you're proposing with the ""any number of other taxes that are not included in this pledge."" Unless you're going to specifically put in a tax on yachts, which wouldn't pay for anything, a massive boost in capital gains taxes, or some kind of property tax that only kicks in when you've got a personal residence above a certain square footage, you're looking at a raise on some other commodity based tax like a VAT or sales tax that would hit the middle class far harder than the upper ranges, who are not in a position to spend most of their income on goods and services. The marginal tax rate on income is the only tax model we've got in this country that doesn't amount to making the middle class pay for *everything.*

Now, if you would like to argue that deficit spending is perfectly OK when we're talking about temporary expenditures, at least I'll understand what you're getting at (and will agree to disagree).

Here both moderate conservatives and the most extreme fascists vote Republican. moderate liberals and the most extreme communists vote Democrat. When we have fewer outlets in which to express our political opinion, we are pigeon-holed into one. And these two-pigeonholes are comprised of a large ideological variety in terms of members, yet in reality their platform only cover a small ideological spectrum. This results in passionate dislike of the other party.

We are not inherently more individualist or selfish, but in the desire to see the country run the way we wanted it to be run, our political system first requires that the OTHER party doesn't get in power. And since there is only one opponent, as long as we discredit them, we will win our power back.

Imagine this in a multi-party government. If a major player is gaining a lot of support, and another major player wants to surpass it, they must recruit a smaller party to form a coalition government. When they win, they have to acknowledge the concerns and platforms of this other party as well, or risk losing their support and the next elections. And if a major party wants to go on a massive discredit campaign much like in US politics, then both parties will go down in popularity. In the US one party can just block all government effectiveness for a term and then the population will go on their side. In Europe a party blocking government would first of all not be likely, since the multi-party mosaic would ensure that no party gains THAT much strength (I know it still happens periodically). Also, a party recognized for doing that would be pariahs in government and would lose support.

European (and other global) politicians in a republic system are no less selfish, individualist, or passionate about their own views. It's only that the US system forces no cooperation at all.

But as a culture, I believe we are pretty damn caring. We have a lot of problems, bad people, ignorant people, selfish people, but once upon a time we were known for being warm, kind and open-armed, and damn it, I believe at some level we still are. I know for sure everyone's a long shot nicer and more considerate here than in Asia (I'm there a lot, and I'm Asian). I've never been to Europe so I can't compare. But selflessness and generosity to the fellow man being present means that at some level we aren't ruled by our selfish desires. We have some concern for the common good, but we just happen to have different visions of how to best make the common good better.",c64pimw,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

"&gt; There are both State and Federal mechanisms for corrective action.

but that's just my point -- there are NOT Federal mechanisms for corrective action. Not if you're gay or transgender. And there aren't state mechanisms either in some states. I would love to think that if I just got a bunch of people together and wrote up a little petition, we could change that. But in many states, it's politically impossible to pass anything that even sounds remotely pro-gay.

I'm not sure that I will. If Muslim terrorists attack the US, and I'm a Muslim, it sounds like you would say that is one of those times. What if a Christian terrorist group attacks the US, and I'm a Christian? Then should I stand up and voice my opinion? What if some white people in my town join the KKK? Am I obligated as a white person to say, ""You know, I think *those* white people are crazy. I don't agree with them at all.""

"In regards to Political Ad Disclosure, personally, I would like to know where the money is coming from. More transparency is generally good, right? Sure, knowing who is giving the money does not give me any more power to stop them, but it does give the free market more information to operate on. 

If I understand correctly, many Conservatives believe very strongly in the power of the free market. For instance, many would say we should do away with federal regulations against companies polluting, instead depending on the free market to discourage those who pollute by not patronizing their business. This may be an oversimplification, so please forgive me for that, and let me know if I am inherently wrong on this point.

Wouldn't it then be beneficial to have more transparency in political campaign financing, so that the free market has the opportunity to weigh in on those responsible for flooding politics with money?

Agreed on Wall Street.

Yes, it most certainly is a weighing of Pros and Cons, and I can understand voting for the side that aligns more often with your ideals. For me personally, the social policies pushed by Republicans are so disagreeable that I could not really consider voting for them.

"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_%28sociology%29

It means when a business will enter the market it won't act differently than other businesses. In this case meaning paying their workers higher wages. The environment of running a business means you want to keep costs down to maximize profit, this means that businesses will follow this principle. Businesses in similar workforce environments will all settle on extremely similar wage settings because of isomorphism. (your workforce population being the outside environmental factor, which is the same to all the businesses in the same region as the workforce)

Another reason why businesses won't have higher wages than their competitors is because of it's small probability in attracting the better more productive workers anyway. No matter what, everywhere there are going to be good and bad people at their jobs, this is at all pay grades and a frustrating fact to us all in our personal lives. If a company wants a higher quality workforce they're more likely to invest something like a better training program as it's probably more cost effective than simply raising wages. You're just never going to get a monopoly on the higher quality workers by trying to raise wages, it's simply not cost effective to a company.",c3vih86,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
