"Cutting what he wants in 3 years would literally make many agencies disappear overnight. Not only does it ignore realpolitik (aka impossible to do) its not.. .well.. sane. Cutting income tax would cut a massive portion of the government revenue and force very extreme cuts almost instantly. This is very similar to what pinochet did with Chili. While it will cause an economic boom in the long run it will also cost years of depression. The Pinochet plan is widely criticized even by Milton Friedman for being too much too fast. Extreme change on an economy without allowing time for the market to gradually adapt has a very steep price.

&gt;Your country cannot afford to go to war, it will bankrupt you and most likely cause a MASSIVE depression,

None of this is grounded in reason. The military budget is totally in tune, and even historically low as a % of GDP. The military isn't the problem and thus war with Iran wouldn't be either. The biggest issue right now fiscally is Medicare. That's where our revenue is going. If you want to talk fiscal conservatism though having a nuclear Iran hold the Gulf hostage, and thus where we get our oil, is far from a fiscally sound choice.

&gt; it will bankrupt you

The U.S. can't go bankrupt. It's not possible. All of its debt is held in its own currency and it can print to pay if need be.

&gt;cause a MASSIVE depression

Printing money to pay the debt would lower the value of the debt as well as pay it off. Inflation works against debt holders. This would not cause a depression it all but rather it would risk stagflation as seen in the 70's. High inflation rates aren't a good thing really but depressions are traditionally caused by a shortage in money supply and not an increase.

&gt;and they are asking YOU for bailouts, when you already owe China Billions of dollars.

Europe is really asking Germany for bailouts and to some extent Russia and the US. The vast majority of US debt is held by the US government - not China. China has a sizable chunk of debt but this is honestly a scare tactic. Fear of China causes fear of debt when its really unfounded. If we were to start paying down the debt paying it all off would be stupid. We want low interest debt as it causes growth and by proxy increased revenue. On top of this with debt comes the dollar being used as the staple currency around the world. People trading in dollars is a good thing for US interests.

"Norquist's pledge is a pledge to never, under any circumstances, raise income tax rates. Or to remove any ""loophole"" that would have the effect of raising income tax revenue without introducing some other loophole that would offset it dollar for dollar.

Why would not being OK with that hardline rule have any effect on what I would think of lowering a tax rate (other than doing so without removing the rule would mean the lower tax rate would be what we're stuck with even if it didn't have the effect we were looking for)? Not having the pledge in place does not mean wanting everyone to swear to raise all taxes nor does it mean I would be against lowering taxes where appropriate, it means I don't want my representatives removing an option from the table even when that option is the only fiscally responsible one.

Similarly, I would be against a pledge to never, ever go to war. I don't want to go to war but I certainly don't want people who would never consider the option.

I've explained twice now how Norquist's pledge is no good when paying for something like a war, which is a *temporary* massive expenditure and you've just wandered off into social programs each time. Why? The only possible point you can be trying to make with that that I can see is that Norquist's pledge discourages doing long term massive expenditures that are not already paid for and that's not what I'm arguing Norquist's pledge is not good for. 

And raising taxes on the middle class is exactly what you're proposing with the ""any number of other taxes that are not included in this pledge."" Unless you're going to specifically put in a tax on yachts, which wouldn't pay for anything, a massive boost in capital gains taxes, or some kind of property tax that only kicks in when you've got a personal residence above a certain square footage, you're looking at a raise on some other commodity based tax like a VAT or sales tax that would hit the middle class far harder than the upper ranges, who are not in a position to spend most of their income on goods and services. The marginal tax rate on income is the only tax model we've got in this country that doesn't amount to making the middle class pay for *everything.*

Now, if you would like to argue that deficit spending is perfectly OK when we're talking about temporary expenditures, at least I'll understand what you're getting at (and will agree to disagree).

"Our society has been shaped by our two-party system (the result of the way our Constitution was drawn up). Our politics are now devolved into a two-sided mudslinging party because of it. In many European governments, various systems mostly allow smaller parties representation in government roughly proportional to their constituency in the population. Here both moderate conservatives and the most extreme fascists vote Republican. moderate liberals and the most extreme communists vote Democrat. When we have fewer outlets in which to express our political opinion, we are pigeon-holed into one. And these two-pigeonholes are comprised of a large ideological variety in terms of members, yet in reality their platform only cover a small ideological spectrum. This results in passionate dislike of the other party.

We are not inherently more individualist or selfish, but in the desire to see the country run the way we wanted it to be run, our political system first requires that the OTHER party doesn't get in power. And since there is only one opponent, as long as we discredit them, we will win our power back.

Imagine this in a multi-party government. If a major player is gaining a lot of support, and another major player wants to surpass it, they must recruit a smaller party to form a coalition government. When they win, they have to acknowledge the concerns and platforms of this other party as well, or risk losing their support and the next elections. And if a major party wants to go on a massive discredit campaign much like in US politics, then both parties will go down in popularity. In the US one party can just block all government effectiveness for a term and then the population will go on their side. In Europe a party blocking government would first of all not be likely, since the multi-party mosaic would ensure that no party gains THAT much strength (I know it still happens periodically). Also, a party recognized for doing that would be pariahs in government and would lose support.

European (and other global) politicians in a republic system are no less selfish, individualist, or passionate about their own views. It's only that the US system forces no cooperation at all.

But as a culture, I believe we are pretty damn caring. We have a lot of problems, bad people, ignorant people, selfish people, but once upon a time we were known for being warm, kind and open-armed, and damn it, I believe at some level we still are. I know for sure everyone's a long shot nicer and more considerate here than in Asia (I'm there a lot, and I'm Asian). I've never been to Europe so I can't compare. But selflessness and generosity to the fellow man being present means that at some level we aren't ruled by our selfish desires.

"In regards to Political Ad Disclosure, personally, I would like to know where the money is coming from. More transparency is generally good, right? Sure, knowing who is giving the money does not give me any more power to stop them, but it does give the free market more information to operate on. 

If I understand correctly, many Conservatives believe very strongly in the power of the free market. For instance, many would say we should do away with federal regulations against companies polluting, instead depending on the free market to discourage those who pollute by not patronizing their business. This may be an oversimplification, so please forgive me for that, and let me know if I am inherently wrong on this point.

Wouldn't it then be beneficial to have more transparency in political campaign financing, so that the free market has the opportunity to weigh in on those responsible for flooding politics with money?

It means when a business will enter the market it won't act differently than other businesses. In this case meaning paying their workers higher wages. The environment of running a business means you want to keep costs down to maximize profit, this means that businesses will follow this principle. Businesses in similar workforce environments will all settle on extremely similar wage settings because of isomorphism. (your workforce population being the outside environmental factor, which is the same to all the businesses in the same region as the workforce)

Another reason why businesses won't have higher wages than their competitors is because of it's small probability in attracting the better more productive workers anyway. No matter what, everywhere there are going to be good and bad people at their jobs, this is at all pay grades and a frustrating fact to us all in our personal lives. If a company wants a higher quality workforce they're more likely to invest something like a better training program as it's probably more cost effective than simply raising wages.

**Without proper education, unprotected sex happens. Abstinence only sex ed is not proper education.**

In any case, sex is going to happen. I get that you didn't get any in high school, but statistically across all of human history, 13~17 year  olds are usually second most sexually active group (the first being the elderly, especially in recent years.)

This is a function of nature, and is going to happen no matter what you think or what you do. You cannot change this, republicans have been trying for the last 100~120 years, they have failed with all tactics they have ever tried.

**However** when you give kids the tools to make the right choices, A) Government mandated and funded sexual education and B) Low price or free contraceptives or birth control, you **lower teen pregnancy, lower poverty, lower abortions, lower teen sex surprisingly enough, and lower the number of children that have to be put up for adoption by those teen mothers.**

Incidentally, if you also have **easy, legal, cheap, shame-free access to abortion** you lower the number of abortions being performed, and you lower the poverty rate, and you directly help people.

Now I mentioned 'lowering the poverty rate.' I can tell you're an incredibly selfish individual who actually hates his children and practically all other humans. That's fine, whatever makes you hard I guess.

quote from the [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._national_anthem_protests_(2016–present) -  

&gt;&gt;Kaepernick pledged to donate the first $1 million of his $11.9 million salary from the 2016–2017 season to different organizations that help communities in need.[19] He pledged to donate $100,000 per month for 10 months to various organizations.[20] Days later, the San Francisco 49ers matched Kaepernick by pledging $1 million to two organizations addressing racial and social inequality.[21] Kaepernick has been following through on his commitment and has donated $900,000 as of September 2017 to groups including Meals on Wheels, United We Dream, Black Veterans for Social Justice and many others.[22][23] Kaepernick has also held “Know Your Rights” camps for young people of color.[24] The camps include legal education from attorneys that give advice on how to interact with police when being detained and lectures from prominent academics on the history of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.[25][26] The NFL Player’s Union named Kaepernick the Week One MVP in September 2017 for his charity work related to the protest.[27]

&gt;Oh, and because of their actions the focus isn't on police brutality. It's on them and their divisive behavior.

&gt;They aren't uniting people behind a cause. They're dividing people.

This is just false. They are copying Colin Kaepernick, whose stated reason for kneeing is to protest police brutality there is no other way to interpret this. 

As for there divisive behaviour Kaepernick took great care to not offend people with his protest, he started off sitting but after talking to a US military veteran chose to kneel instead.

&gt;Kaepernick opted to kneel during the U.S. national anthem rather than sit as he did in their previous games. He explained his decision to switch was an attempt to show more respect to former and current U.S. military members while still protesting during the anthem after having a conversation with former NFL player and U.S. military veteran Nate Boyer.

There is no way can interpret this as an attempt to divide people when he took specific care to not offend anyone.

I was under the impression that the original bill passed by the House (a different bill, Affordable Health Care for America Act) did have public option provisions, but skimming Wikipedia doesn't seem to support that.

Either way, she only abandoned public option when it was determined that there was no way for the Senate to get that passed.

As for ""essentially opposing single payer"", if you read and listen to her statements, it's not that she's opposed to single payer, it's that she was focused on saving the ACA from Trump's and the GOPs attacks. Her issue wasn't with the concept of single player or medicare for all (though Bernie's bill was severely lacking and basically just said ""we should expand Medicare for everyone!"" without any actual details on how).

&gt; ""Right now, I’m protecting the Affordable Care Act,"" Pelosi told a small group of reporters at a meeting Tuesday in her Capitol Hill office. ""None of these other things, whether it’s Bernie’s [bill], can really prevail unless we have the Affordable Care Act protected.""

&gt; Pelosi defended her position at a time when some progressives are taking aim at her leadership, noting that she has backed a single-payer system since before she entered Congress.

&gt;""I’ve been carrying single-payer signs as party chair of California,"" she said, referring to her tenure decades ago as state party leader. ""I’m a progressive from San Francisco. Proud liberal. I have my own kind of credibility on these subjects.""",,0,e98ym8w,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

"&gt; Are you thinking for even one second before responding? We've been talking about scams for the last several posts. What service/product does a Nigerian prince or fake anti-virus service scam provide? Because five seconds on Google will show you people who have made millions off either.

Exceedingly few people, who took advantage of exceedingly few exceedingly naive people.  If this is the crux of your argument as to why we shouldn't have a market in education, it applies universally - why even have a market at all?  After all, less than 1% of 1% of people fell for Nigerian prince schemes, so clearly people are too stupid/evil to be left to their own devices, the bureaucrats should manage their lives, right?

&gt;Except that two posts ago, you said that happiness is the only valid measure of value. This entire point disagreement started because you said that because two parents were happy, there MUST be value.

Yes, and you made a good point, happiness isn't value, *value* is value, and it's up to free people to decide when that value is satisfactory to them.

&gt;Cute that you conveniently ignored the point that the wisdom of the crowd is easily subverted by marketed.

I didn't ignore that.  I disagreed with it.  The ""your free will can be stolen from you by product placement"" is nothing less than leftist anti-market agitation.  Advertising is speech, nothing more, and nothing less.

&gt;If the wisdom of the crowd is as infallible as you claim, then it shouldn't be possible for millions of liberals to believe in all the positions you undoubtedly feel are provably false.

The wisdom of the crowd applies to markets, not politics.  What liberals believe isn't wrong because the belief itself, it's wrong because they want it forced on everyone else at gunpoint.  Beliefs in caring for the less fortunate, not discriminating against people based on race/ethnicity/sexuality aren't bad beliefs, and I would argue that *most* people ultimately agree with the logic that undergirds these beliefs - they just oppose the violently-enforced political policies that follow from them (i.e. ""give us more of your paycheck *to help the poor*"" or ""BAKE THE CAKE YOU BIGOT"").",,0,dr1wpr2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And I suppose in order to salvage that argument you're going to say when your child was a fetus your child wasn't actually your child right? Who was the child's father before birth?

And please while responding be sure to acknowledge the dictionary definition of child extends before birth https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/child because most people who hopelessly entangle themselves in this argument eventually pretend like the world ""child"" only counts after birth. It's pretty obvious it doesn't work that way, the phrase describing a woman carrying a fetus in her womb known as ""she's with child"" has been around since the middle ages.

I never said that, I only said do not get conquered by fear. It does not mean that we are not supposed to be cautious about it. But overly cautious ( fear) leads to a bad thing.
As for muslims problem, imho the best approach is to debate them. Debate is the best weapon to change their mind about their violent doctrine. You can kill terrorist, but you cannot kill their idea / faith. 
You aren't going to solve the problem by fear.

Clearly the Loveable Left only tolerates those who agree with them."" Completely ignoring the fact that maybe some folks dont want kids looking up to a professional BSer as a role model.

My main point is that there's a habit of those on the [far] right who will use one's demographic when conveneint to stand against any accusations of sexism/racism/-phobias/etc. or stick it to Liberals. But it almost never lasts long for one reason or another.

Hence, ""Where's Kelleyanne?"" Ignoring that she didnt even get a role at the Big Boys table for all her undeniable hard work, she seems to have recently fallen off the face of the earth despite being considered an important person.

Bonus case in point: Mr. Yianoppolis was championed as the ""gay immigrant that liberals hated"", but was dropped super quick once his pro-pedo comment became known; it stopped being conveneint.",,0,dggtstc,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"I think everyone here grossly misunderstands Paul Ryan.

I've followed the man for years, read his book, etc.

I knew that when he ""endorsed"" Trump, he absolutely didn't mean it. If you know Paul Ryan, you know that Trump stands against basically everything Paul Ryan believes in. But he did it because he had to, and because he was going to run the Republican National Convention. If he had opposed Trump and a brokered convention took place, Trump's people would have howled night and day that the thing was rigged. At least with an obligatory ""endorsement"", he appears impartial to Trump supporters.

Furthermore, I think everyone misses out on why GOP elites shilled for Trump as hard as they did: they knew he was going to lose. Reince Priebus, Paul Ryan, every thinking man in America knew Trump would lose the general election. When that did happen, no one wanted the narrative that Trump lost because the ""Establishment"" didn't support him. People like Jeb, Cruz, or Kasich don't run the Party. People like Paul Ryan do, and they don't get the luxury of taking moral stands without massive consequences in right-wing media. If Paul Ryan had opposed Trump from Day 1, he would have provided ammunition for the ""Backstab Theory"" of why Trump lost. By supporting him, he denies that ammunition for that argument.

Now, however, Paul Ryan and others have practically abandoned Trump to his fate. What changed?

Congressional races.

Reince Priebus didn't have a problem with Trump until the polls started coming in that suggested Trump was dragging down down-ballot races. It was common knowledge that Trump was going to crash and burn, but the possibility that he would drag Congress with him was not as certain. With that possibility, tactics changed, and hence now we get the ""you're on your own"" stance of Paul Ryan concerning Trump. He's still trying to avoid feeding ammunition to the ""Backstab Theory"", but he's also trying to save GOP control of Congress.

If you don't believe me, I would invite you to go read some transcripts from any recent Rush Limbaugh broadcast. There's a narrative war in the GOP that no one picks up on, and bad narratives can be poisonous to the GOP in the long-run, like the infamous ""Romney didn't win because he wasn't conservative enough"" myth.

tl;dr: Paul Ryan despises Trump, but he's duty-bound to support him so Trump II doesn't happen.",,0,d8tzrwj,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

FYI the idea of 'seven heavens' is very old, much older than Islam and is found in older religions like Hinduism and Judaism. Not surprisingly Islam copied this idea like so much else.

The seven heavens or layers of sky coincide with the seven heavenly bodies which were observable with the naked eye (before the invention of telescopes). They were believed to inhabit their own [layer or sphere and to rotate one on top of the other.](http://www.planetnarnia.com/assets/images/94/Cosmos.jpg) They are, in no particular order:

1. the moon

2. the sun

3. venus

4. mars

5. jupiter

6. mercury

"Never been a Muslim, so take what follows as very generic advice.  

ALL dating is going into a different culture.  Even amongst Americans.  One family has a completely different tradition from another usually.  Somebody cooks a ham at Christmas, another does turkey.  One family loves Halloween, another does a huge block party on July 4th.  One may be from a Baptist sect, another from a Catholic.  But at the heart of it all, it's about getting to know all of the person you are interested in.  The person is not the culture, and the cultural traditions do not dictate who the person will be.

Ultimately when two people do decide to get wed, then there's usually a blending of old traditions, and a creation of new.  Usually one person will want to keep one or two traditions that are important to them, the other will want to keep one or two that are important to them, and the couple will share in those together.  Invariably, traditions that have little meaning will fall by the wayside, and new ones will come up.  For all you know, there might be one or two little things that your new partner does that you will consider to be fascinating, fun, or really meaningful. Same with your partner.  And the two of you will likely end up doing something completely new that has meaning only for the two of you and your children.

So try not to think of it as loosing your culture, but as refining what you have, keeping the good, loosing the bad, and discovering something new and exciting.",,0,c7mutkj,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The most famous case of apostasy in Malaysia is probably that of Lina Joy's. In Malaysia, if you're born Islam, your religion will be stated on your identification card. This rule does not apply to non-Muslims. She was baptized in 1998 and had appealed to have her conversion legally recognized by the Malaysian courts and to have the word Islam removed from her identity car but remains unsuccessful till now. It is only by having this change made that she be would be able to marry her Christian boyfriend of Indian origin because a Muslim woman cannot marry a non-Muslim man. In this kind of cases, the non Muslim partner have to convert to Islam to have the marriage legally recognized in Malaysia.

First of all, this isn't a defense mechanism. I'll take that as a compliment. 
The reason I referred to the Quran was because it is the ultimate source of reference and guide to a Muslim.
Individually, I haven't really been convinced about Hadiths (the source and integrity) as it could have been infiltrated by some for personal motives.

Religion is different from communities

&gt;He could if he wanted to. Why not copy Athenian or Roman democracy? He had no intention to. It's about the claims he made and the reason he did it all. For his own personal lust for power

Okay but realistically how well would Arabian society adapted to such a profound change. I would argue that some Islamic countries TODAY are not ready for democracy. I mean you went from a culture that would bury newborn girls in the sand and would go to war with another tribe because they said something about someones mother. Just doesn't seem feasible for him to have established a working democracy. Even today autocracies tend to bring more stability to a nation than democracy, because for a democracy to work you need to have the right institutions in place to ensure the system works. Just look at Libya and Egypt, they go from dictatorships to democracies yet 40% of Egypt is still angry.

Not that there aren't alot of questionable issue-orgs out there, regardless of politics.  However, the advent of Bush the Lesser's era seemed to be when conservative issue-orgs really started to keep more of the $ they raised; either as a percentage of ""administration/overhead"" or outright keeping.

This actually makes alot of sense when one considers the authoritarian bent of the folks still in the GOP since 2000 and especially Teabaggers.  They'll buy anything as long as its a pre-approved authority/figurehead telling the tale or begging for bucks.

"&gt; • How would the Republicans in the House and Senate try to screw her over during her presidency? Benghazi investigation 2.0?

After increasing their House majority and retaking the Senate in the 2018 ""red wave"" midterm, the Republican Congress would be theatening a government shutdown to against repeal the ACA and ramping up the investigations of various tinfoil scandals from Uranium One to Benghazi 18.0.

&gt; • Would the Parkland students have felt as hostile towards her as they are to Trump? How would she feel about a group of young progressives campaigning for gun control?

She would probably support them. But nothing would move through the GOP Congress.

&gt; • How would the economy be faring?

Steady growth, similar to the Obama years, but perhaps with incomes rising a big faster as we hover near full employment. Given the reduced level of fiscal stimulus in a late expansion (no GOP Tax Scam), Fed Chair Yellen might well have kept rates lower.  That and no dumbass elective trade wars means we'd probably see fewer stock market oscillations as well. 

&gt; • Would Kim Jong Un still hold the summit with her?

No. And she wouldn't have made the mistake of holding it. We'd be in the same holding pattern, perhaps pursuing 6-party talks and using sanctions as leverage. And NK would be making symbolic threat displays. 

&gt;Would she have issues with the disgruntled Bernie Bros and progressives? Would they be more willing to fight with a Democratic presidency?

We'd have divided government and gridlock, which would frustrate people who want dramatic change. It would look a lot like the 90s where Bill Clinton was seen by progressives as basically a Republican. We'd see the ""no difference"" rhetoric as W's dumpster fire receded into memory. Perhaps Hillart would be more aggressive using executive power than Obama was to achieve progressive priorities. Or perhaps Republicans, having lost three consecutive presidential elections and facing a 5-4 or 6-3 liberal SCOTUS would moderate somewhat. 

&gt; • How would Hillary have handled the Jamal Kashoggi affair?

It probably would not have happened because of the difference in the Clinton Admin's rhetoric toward journalists and Saudi Arabia's fear of potential consequencea.

 &gt;• How would Hillary’s win affect the midterm elections?

2018 would almost certainly have been a red wave, and with so many Dem seats up in the Senate, deep losses would likely have cost Dems control of the upper chamber until 2022 or 2024 at the very earliest. 

 &gt;• What would Tim Kaine be up to as Vice President?

Thumb twiddling? Who knows?

&gt; • What would our orange friend be up to during her presidency?

Hosting Trump TV, ranting about the rigged election, but basically continuing to get away with his cons without any sort of punishment.

&gt;Other issues

Clinton would obviously have run a much more competent administration and, without the executive time tweets, the constant raging dumpster fire, and enjoying the political benefits of the Obama economy, could possibly have approval ratings in the high 40s to low 50s (not much higher because politics is so polarized these days).

"I agree. I agree that a reporter is not free to write what he wants with the tone he desires and purely objectively if he wants to maximise his earnings or advance his career. I agree that the freedom of the press is limited, if the reporter wants to eat as a freelance, or keep his job with CNN (or Fox news). I agree that networks and their parent companies, dictate what and how reporters should write maybe not overtly by saying it outright, but discretely, by making it so that freelance work that does not match the tone and narrative they want to promulgate does not get bought and published and leaving it to the reporter to catch on if he wants to see money. 
But unless the government has influence over some or most of these news outlets, through strawmen operating in their parent companies or at the news outlets themselves, then the freedom of the press is not limited by Trump, or the government, but by the companies employing the reporters or buying content from freelancers, who in turn pursue economic or even political goals.  

My question did not make this clear, but I was thinking more along the lines how could the press have any more freedom with regard to the government, given that the current administration are the ones in the hotseat.  

It is a fact that a reporter is severally limited to write about what he wants with the tone he wants through the dictate of his employers, it is no coincidence that Fox news was perceived as anti Obama, or CNN as unhinged anti Trump and that is a serious problem that factually limits the freedom of the press, but again I was thinking more about the lines of the freedom and limitations imposed on the press by the government and this administration in particular.

"&gt;So to answer you question, liberals question the use of anti-Semitism as a charge to deflect from legitimate criticism of Israeli policy.

With all due respect, often when someone says ""what you are saying is antisemitic"" in response to something about Israel, this is blown off. This seems to suggests that no criticism of Israel is ever antisemitic. Clearly however, one can criticize Israel while being antisemitic in doing so (i.e. Israel secretly controls the world, Israel created ISIS, No nation has more human rights violations than Israel, etc.). Of course one can criticize Israel without being antisemitic, but who gets to say where that line is? Why is it that gentiles feel they have the right to dismiss the feelings of Jewish people as ""merely a cover for Israel"", when other allegations of bigotry are rarely brushed off with such ease?

Also, it's worth noting that my original post never mentioned Israel. Why is it that every time a Jewish person says ""I'm concerned about antisemtism"" the argument is diverted into one about Israel? With all due respect, I don't see the concerns of bigotry against other groups being diverted by liberals in the same way.

"&gt;Regardless of who said it, this remains one of the most idiotic sayings that constantly persists.

Actually, I'd say ""It's the exception that proves the rule"" which is the most idiotic saying that persists.  WTF?

&gt;It’s an argument I see often, mostly from people online that inevitably prove to be younger, less educated and with substantially less income than me.

I'm 50, with a degree from a prestigious university, and a very respectable income.

I'm also still a liberal, and don't think I'm an idiot.

But the way I view politics is vastly more nuanced than when I was younger.  I thought pharmaceutical companies (actually, pretty much all companies) were evil, wars were all unjustifiable, anyone owning a gun was crazy, and ""to each according to their need, from each according to their ability"" seemed like a pretty cool idea.

I now think we need a strong economy and successful companies, and the pharma needs to make a profit to be motivated to innovate.  But I also believe in regulations to keep them serving the public interest.

I still think war should be a last resort, but that there are bad people out there who need to be stopped from harming innocents.

I know a lot of people who like to hunt and do so responsibly, and are in circumstances where self defense is an issue - but I think gun ownership should be seriously regulated, and the types of guns controlled.

I think that without personal incentive to work hard, many won't.  But that doesn't mean I think children and the poor should starve.

In other words, I don't think there is a case where I've changed who I'd vote for in all those years, but I'm a lot more skeptical about those promising easy fixes.

But I also think we desperately need the dreamers, the ones who see a path to a better future, not the obstacles that would keep you from getting there.

My aunt, on the other hand, who lived her whole life in Greenwich Village, never was exposed to the nuance, and refers to herself as th last remaining communist (hey, she grew up in the 60's).  The idealism that is so compelling in a young person seems to me a little silly in someone in their 70s.

"They'll overturn the following cases

&gt;Roe v. Wade (States will be able to reban abortion)

This would be substantially difficult to challenge and get to the Supreme Court. More likely you will see the Court stop striking down restrictions on abortion like they did in *Casey*.  We have had a Conservative Supreme Court since *before* Roe v. Wade, and it hasn't been overturned. If a state were to ban abortion, a district court would be bound to *Roe* and declare the law unconstitutional, and if it found its way up on appeal the question would and could only be ""Does this violate *Roe*?""  The answer would be yes, and it would be an extraordinary reach that Roberts would never take to radically expand the scope of the case like that. So you'll see things like limits on where abortion clinics can be, high fees for abortions, restrictions on what a doctor can inform a patient about abortions, etc. that will probably pass, but *Roe* will stand.

&gt;Lawrence v. Texas (States will be able to recriminalize homosexuality)

Not happening.  This would require an entire state to attempt to criminalize anal sex, which would be such a massively unpopular undertaking, even in Alabama.  This one also runs into the problem of it being extremely difficult to get a broad enough question in front of the Supreme Court to challenge it.  This one is solid.  Furthermore, it was a 6-3 decision, one that two conservatives voted with the liberal block on.

&gt;Obergefell v. Hodges (States will be able to ban gay marriage)

This one is impossible to challenge directly, but you will likely see attempts to impede LGBT access to marriage work.  Stuff like allowing those who give out marriage licenses to deny them to LGBT couples on religious grounds might pass through and they will attempt to limit the reach of *Obergefell*, but this is a very hard decision to overturn as well due to its nature.

&gt;Griswold v. Connecticut (Leading to states banning all contraception)

What you will more likely see is restrictions on when and where contraceptives can be sold being upheld.

&gt;Engel v. Vitale (Leading to states reestablishing school prayer)

This one is definitely in danger of being overturned. 1st Amendment challenges on prayer in school almost always are unique in some aspect enough to get a broad question in front of the Court, and this one can be either overturned or effectively neutered much more easily than others.  What the Court will probably allow is prayer time that is nondenominational and students are allowed to excuse themselves from it.

&gt;Abington School District v. Schempp (leading states to reintroduce mandatory bible reading in public schools)

This one is a bridge too far, and this was an 8-1 decision. It's not going anywhere 

&gt;Texas v. Johnson (leading states to reban flag burning)

Scalia wrote the majority opinion on this case.  Conservative legal scholars are pretty split on this.  Roberts and Gorsuch wouldn't go for this at all.  The only Justice I think who would even consider it is Clarence Thomas 

&gt;Edwards v. Aguillard (reestablishing the teaching of creationism in public schools)

This could be modified the same way Engel would be.  1st Amendment rights of the teacher to teach evolution how they believe it to be.

So I don't think you're wrong at all: accomplishing even 25% of what Warren wants to do is going to be hard. She'll also be up against an even higher level of gamesmanship in Congress than Obama was. But Republicans' Senate vulnerability in 2020 combined with the liability that Trump presents could very well lead to a Congress that's blue enough to do some of what Warren has in mind. She'll also have wind at her back in the form of supporters who saw Obama get shut down on immigration reform and gun policy, and who are ready to treat activism as a year-round sport. 

She'd also be taking office with the benefit of having seen Republican efforts to dismantle both the ACA and her baby the CFPB. She'd also take office armed with data that she didn't have during the Obama years (specifically, I'm thinking of the ZIP-code-level economic data that came out circa 2016). She saw the recovery work amazingly while at the same time leaving some neighborhoods behind, and she saw that information go unrecognized due to the lack of good and granular data. 

So for me, starting with the premise that Warren is incredibly intelligent and is thinking several moves ahead, I'm guessing that she's advocating for major changes not just because she sincerely believes that they're the right thing to do, but because she thinks she can do it - and do it right - if we have her back.

"I disagree about Bernie.   In full disclosure, I am a Bernie supporter.   

Your TLDR is a sort of caricature of the situation.   Take Robert Reich, a cabinet member of Bill Clinton, and a famous economist.   He has a couple documentaries about wealth inequality in our country, and the many serious problems it entails.   He said (slightly paraphrased)  ""Hillary is the ideal president for the system we have.   Bernie is the is ideal president for the system we SHOULD have.""   

I think many informed people would say that it's not about hating on rich people (I don't hate rich people).   It's about restoring some sort of balance to our society.   We have an insane level of economic inequality.   Even your average conservative on the street would prefer less inequality than we have (based on sampling).   Most Americans are unaware of how severe the inequality is, and most Americans, regardless of political persuasion, favor less inequality than we have.

It's not wrong to support a candidate who explicitly wants to address these issues.   It's been a long time since we've had a president who really wants to work for regular people.   We've had a long stream of presidents and politicians who will work tirelessly for the economic elite.   IT's worse now because the economic elite are the one's paying for the elections.

Keep in mind you even have billionaires like Warren Buffet talking about paying less taxes than their secretaries!   Why shouldn't people be demanding some change in this arena?   

And I don't think Hillary is going to be the one to do it.   I think she'll be a good president for wealthy people.   She'll be a vicious military hawk - probably more than any republican, because she's a woman AND a Democrat, and that means she has to prove she has more balls than everyone else (not to mention, it's good for business).

"It's difficult to engage constructively with someone who has their own private semantics around the terms in question, so I'm not sure what more we can do if you don't use the standard definition of ""race privilege,"" which of course includes non-intentional factors.

&gt; All you've got are a bunch of curious studies that can be explained rationally and easily refuted

Okay, lets look at each one in turn.  I'll leave the NBER one for last given that there is more to say on it.

**1.** Disparity in public education offering.  Your claim is that this is a class issue, not a race issue.  However, as I've said, both issues apply and they exacerbate each other.  The Stanford Data Education Archive is a good source of nationwide education data and analysis.  [This NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/29/upshot/money-race-and-success-how-your-school-district-compares.html) has two really nice interactive graphs of data from their recent study.  If economics were the only difference we would expect to see the pink, blue, and green dots evenly intermixed where they overlap.  But they aren't; the pink dots are higher up on average.  We must reject pure socioeconomics.  Race plays a role here.  So if race plays a role, is that due to the quality of education provided or the amount of knowledge the students reap from it?  Certainly there will be aspects of both, but one clear way to examine this question is to look at school funding.  There are well documented disparities in school funding based on race *and not socioeconomics alone*.  ([Source](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/public-school-funding-and-the-role-of-race/408085/)  How do you square that source with your worldview?

**2.** Regarding blood lead levels and public health in general, you have not offered a refutation.  But to add some information here, there is substantial literature examining the effect of both socioeconomics and race on blood lead.  The finding is that both are correlated, as you'd expect, but that the effect of race is much larger than the effect of socioeconomics.  For instance, [here is one such study](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/6/1308) that finds that being below the poverty line approximately doubles the risk of a child having elevated BLL.  However, being black multiplies the risk by 3x for mildly elevated BLL and 13x for extremely elevated BLL.  Socioeconomics don't tell the whole story.

**3.** Back to the NBER study.

&gt; If the study used something like Terrence &amp; Monique vs the white names, I guarantee there wouldn't be a discrepancy

They used 9 names for each gender/race combination, so 36 names in all.  The names made up between 3 and 4% of all births.  Also, please note the meta-study I linked to found the trend in more than 20 such studies with variations on the methodology.  But since you have such a good handle on this: without looking, on the honor system, please order the following names from highest to lowest callback rate.  If you think two are approximately equal you can say that.  Female: Carrie, Ebony, Emily, Latonya, Sarah, Tanisha; Male: Leroy, Greg, Jermaine, Matthew, Neil, Tyrone

&gt; That's an argument of authority, attack my argument instead of trying to bash my credentials.

This is the constant plea of a person who wants their criticisms of well established work to be given more respect than they deserve.

"Um, no milk is NOT ok.

It does not ""relieve the pain"". 

Cows are repeatedly inseminated to ensure ongoing milk production. Cows and their calves are separated at birth, causing intense suffering, fear and distress; and this is a routine practice if humans are to continue drinking their milk.

Milk production relies on mechanical milking machines which cause severe discomfort to the cows' udders. Selective breeding, food additives and other best farming practices result in swollen, distended, painful and often infected udders. 
Watch Earthlings for more about the manner in which animals are treated.

Male calfs are a ""by-product"" of the milk indusrty -- hence the saying ""in every glass of milk there is a slice of veal"". These calfs are kept in tiny cages and underfed to ensure they remain small and their flesh white/light and suitable for sale as veal. 

Cows that are milked suffer from numerous infections and complications wrt to their over-utilised udders.

"It's made by coagulating an aqueous extraction of soybean flour. You essentially already have a product at the processing level of seitan before you begin the coagulation process. Also, salt as in sodium chloride, though an ingredient, is not used as a coagulant, but calcium sulfate, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride and other salts are. This is almost identical to the process used to make certain ""quick cheeses""-- boiling with emulsifiers. 

Edit: The relevance of this type of processing, I think, is in how it creates a new food with a unique nutrient balance compared to the original food. Think sugar vs sugar cane juice, white wheat flour vs wheat flour, vital wheat gluten vs wheat flour, whey protein powder vs milk.

You're already starting with soybean flour, and on top of that, you're using water extraction to remove some of the nutrients in order to leave more of other nutrients in the final product-- like with seitan. On top of that, you're using 100°C heat and an acidic environment to further shape the amino acids, peptides, and proteins in this protein rich extraction of soy. 

You can make pasta from soy flour which would be a much better example. The flour is relatively unchanged, the rest of the ingredients remain whole, and you subject it to about 6 minutes(fresh pasta!) of 100°C heat.

"Dear Dudeman137,

I see your account was made today and used to only reply to 2 posts (thus far). I hope you return to reply.

Your reply comes across as apologetic to the application of No True Scotsman.

As Scumbag_Humanist stated:
&gt;Instead of logically dealing with an exception (terrorism) to the universal claim (Islam is religion of peace) , they will just assert that terrorists are not true muslims and all true muslims are peaceful.


This tactic is prevalent. In fact, Mr. Humanist is pointing out the RESULT of applying the No True Scotsman (NTS) fallacy. When NTS is applied, it results in saying ""he's not really muslim becuase....""

Your reply illustrates HOW NTS gets applied. As you stated: 
&gt;This is an objective testable property, and we can easily determine whether the extremists are true Muslims or not by checking if their behaviour is approved of in the Qur'an or not.

A muslim who is embarrassed by the action of another muslim, trys to apply their version of islam to the other muslim's actions. But since this reflection is only done in the context of defending the faith from outside criticism, the result is that the defender ends up concluding that the muslim's actions being discussed are not in correlation to the principles of islam, because to the defender victory in the discussion is only acheived if the religion doesn't endorse the offending muslim's actions. 

The problem with this is that they are. Islam is not what you want it to be, and not what you think it should be. Islam is what it does. When you have muslims from Europe to bangladesh carrying out the same acts of terrorism in the name of their religion, citing the same passages of the koran, then that becomes what islam is. 

I respect you if you look at the imperialistic history and wording of Islam and desire to re-interpret it as a more modern and westernly inspired pantheon philosophy of life, my wife does that. But your westernized view is not the main stream view, it is a minority view. Non-muslims are not concerned with what islam might be, or can become, we're concerned with what it is.

So to tie this back to your reply: I dont really know what side of the fence you're on on this, but i disagree.

**And know that most of the world falls under your exceptions.** Someone who didn't believe that the Quran was Gods word might think you are just rationalizing now...

Islam is supposed to be a complete way of life, and yet it cannot even properly teach the basics of humanity. How to treat others, how to treat women, etc. 

And again, what little it does teach, is not clear for most Muslims, seeing as how they are illiterate. Allahs educational course needs supplementation, we can both agree on that. It has failed in producing an education population, even educated in the one book that God authored himself. Imagine that, most Muslims don't even understand Islam, and this is Gods educational course, the thing that is supposed to set the foundation of life, of faith, and of the drive to learn more.

God has either failed in his educational outcome, or this prevalent ignorance is part of his plan.

Yes, some of the responsibility is on the students, but if the course itself is vague and in an obscure language, then there is responsibility on the teacher as well. And God has failed, or else there wouldn't be so much disagreement between scholars of Islam.

"Conservative dress is culturally-relative.  There is no exclusively-religious reason for you to cover your hair, as it is inextricably bound to cultural convention.  In European society, many religious types, most of them Christians, at one point covered their hair for the sake of piety.  Many people who no longer practice Islam continue to dress this way as a symbol of their continued pride in their cultural heritage.  I have a close friend who describes herself as a culturally-Muslim secular feminist who wore hijab to protest islamophobia and anti-arab racism in white feminist circles.  After visiting Egypt, she decided that she no longer needed to wear hijab to identify as culturally-Muslim and, in fact, many Muslimas do not necessarily wear hijab in majority Muslim countries.  Your decision to wear it or not to wear it has always been a personal one, one that might be motivated by cultural expectations or cultural pride but which nevertheless has no bearing necessarily on your religious expression.  

While I don't suggest using peer pressure as an explanation of your decision to change your dress, it may be helpful to explain to your parents that you wish to challenge the ignorance cultivated by anti-Muslim and anti-Arab rhetoric within liberal white feminist circles that denies it is a Muslim woman's own choice to wear a hijab or not.  Tell them you want other women to ask you about it so they become less fearful, and reassure them that you still intend to dress conservatively in other ways (whether you do or not).

"Well the person has some good points. The main reason socialism fails is because when under socialism there must be a high birth rate to sustain the economy for the next generation if there is any growth. Throughout history most countries that go super left have had a decline in birth rate. Also the adaptation of left wing ideas does not take into account the randomness of the human mind. Economists believe that our system is an exact science, which it is not. Left philosophers treat humans as robots and pawns which is another reason why their ideas fail in practice.

Also leftist ideas are great for lazy and unlucky people. They are terrible for smart and hardworking people. Left ideas take away innovation and creativity. When the human race advances to a Utopian society (which I hope it does) it will not be because of left philosophy, but because of capitalist innovation. Almost every major product that advances the human race further has been from capitalist creativity and intelligence.

Is socialism morally superior to capitalism? If I work hard for 30 years, become very successful, and make $6,000,000 per year because of my hard work, how is it moral for the eoconmy to switch to socialism and take $5,400,000 from me, leaving me with $600,000 and give it to people who are most likely abusing the system? Or is it that there are no jobs being created because the socialist eoconmy has shut down new job creation and innovation? Harder work means you pay more?",,0,d0m518j,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"&gt; How many people still yearn for their childhood today? Even if a child could do adult stuff, I'd imagine there's often a heavy price to pay psychologically.

Like I said, all of this is probably because we live in a society where sex is considered seriouz biznez, taboo, not to be talked about, to be hushed up, something only adults can talk about, etc. Again, imagine that we live in a world where such irrational sentiments towards sex do not exist; imagine that sex is about as natural as shaking hands, or hugging, or patting in the back, or playing, or tell jokes, or tickling or every other interpersonal human interaction. 

This is the same thing that theists would argue against gays. They point out that most of the time these gays live broken lives, are emotionally unstable, jobless, anti-social etc. And from where I come from, they are half-right. But is it because they were gays, or is because of how society treats them? Imagine you are a short person, and you live in a society that hates and despises short people, then of course you'll live a very negative life, feel unhappy all the time, and be emotionally unstable, because the environment around you is telling you are an abomination.

&gt; Biologically and from an evolutionary point of view, there must be a reason why humans take so long to reach maturity. We are complex social creatures. 

If we look at it at a biological standpoint, most kids already hit puberty once they reach 13. So does this mean it's okay for a 50 year old man to have sex with a 13 year old? 

&gt; Another point to note is that a 6 year old girl and a 50 year old are not on the same level. Even if the girl were a genius, experience puts the 50 year old at a higher level. When it comes to informed consent, I'd think the 50 year old man would have far more insight than the 6 year old.

When Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas married, they were 25 years apart. Obviously Douglas has much more life experience, does this mean their marriage was immoral? How about Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore? 

Also lets say that the girl is 18 years old, and she wants to have sex with a 90-year-old man. That's a 72 year gap between them. Would it be moral or immoral?",,0,c5awaoe,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My brother lived there for two years in the '70s. So don't be so fucking sure that you know who you're talking to. I have been watching the developments in Afghanistan and have known with anticipation everything that was going to happen years ahead of time, from 1979 until today. The day after 911 I told friends that we would invade Afghanistan and be stuck in a quagmire for years because the interests behind America's war machine do not have America's interests at heart and would not allow the US CIA and Rangers to decapitate the Taliban and get out.

"Before we take his word that dialogue is damaging to the international pressure and sanctions are the correct course, let's evaluate why he might argue thusly.
1)Largest campaign contribution group is investment &amp; finance. These people would not have large financial ties in Iran due to cold relations and prior sanctioning, so are more heavily invested elsewhere (places that would lose in a relative sense if investment/trade w/ Iran were opened.
2) Number 8 contributor in $$ are pro-Israeli Groups. Obvious reason for the Holocaust rhetoric (clearly not a good analogy, between a human rights catastrophe and a shift in regional power). Israel has much to lose if not allowed to be sole nuclear power in Middle East region.
3) Party concerns. Views successful dialogue as a negative for Republicans because Obama wins, democrats are more tailored to international efforts at cooperation (more Liberal IR ideology), and Republicans are more tailored to a power-based approach (more Realist IR ideology)

"Now the people must realise the broader nature of protesting against the cuts. That such a protest in one nation is futile, for the government is powerless to maintain spending when it must cut taxes for the multinational corporations to ensure we still attract their business, which we are now dependent upon as the nation is far from self-sustainable. Note that I don't just mean direct corporation tax, but also national insurance, income tax etc. as the cost of living must be reduced to a minimum so it is most profitable to employ workers here, for workers are treated like any other commodity in the market system, and to lower their wages their cost of living must fall.

Ultimately the growth of international capitalism will inevitably destroy the sovereignty of nation states, either indirectly through the dependence previously described or more dramatically through the direct intervention of the IMF and the World Bank in nations such as Ecuador, Panama and now even traditionally ""first-world"" nations like Ireland. Who are the people to protest to when the decisions are forced on the nation from afar?

To quote the Nobel Laureate Frederick Soddy:

&gt;""The monetary system is not outworn or senile. 
It is novel, upstart, and imperious, defeating 
technological progress by turning it into the 
channels of destruction, and challenging the 
autonomy not of one nation but of all alike, so 
that now the original authorities constituted for 
the preservation of that autonomy needs must 
fawn upon it to rule at all. Hampered by national 
frontiers, nothing can satisfy it till the whole 
world is made safe for banking, that its funda- 
mental insolvency may defy exposure. Under 
the specious guise of a unification of humanity, 
it aims at absolute dictatorship under which none 
shall be allowed to live save by its favour and for 
the advancement of its transcendent whims.""

Or the Communist Manifesto:

&gt;""The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and of property. It has agglomerated population, centralised the means of production, and has concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this was political centralisation. Independent, or but loosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws, governments, and systems of taxation, became lumped together into one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national class-interest, one frontier, and one customs-tariff.""

This corrupt system will turn the whole world in to one nation under money, ruled by the effective dictatorship that the inequality of capital produces.

To avoid this unsettling future we must unite across nations, and overcome nationalism, patriotism, racism, sexism, homophobia, religious differences and all the divisions the capitalists have created so they can divide and rule.

Change will not come from above. We have never won any rights from a benevolent monarch or a United Nations clause, in fact the main reason we even have the vote is because it was beneficial to the capitalists, who needed more support for their acts supporting free trade and lower taxes.

We cannot settle for minor concessions like progressive taxation or increased benefits, for these policies amount to pushing peas about the plate as these problems are inherent to the capitalist system.

Ultimately we have the best technology we have ever had, the highest populations we have ever supported and a productive capacity that could only be dreamt of in previous ages. Fundamentally this should be a time of prosperity for all, and yet capitalism is holding us back, for there is no incentive to automate work when it is cheaper to use sweatshop labour, and we must conceal and patent our inventions and discoveries so we can monetize them, rather than allowing everyone to improve upon our ideas.

We can never achieve a truly post-scarcity society within the capitalist system, for the system itself depends on scarcity. And so when goods become too abundant, it _must_ produce artificial scarcity to maintain profit in their production, as we see with the absurd Imaginary Property system of patents and copyrights.",,0,c17xezp,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Crap. These things have been around since humans evolved. We're hard wired to instantly distrust anyone who isn't part of our group. The only issue is our leaders taking advantage of this, and that will not change in your imagined utopia.

As for the continued line that ""...there is no incentive to automate work when it is cheaper to use sweatshop labour..."", automation is increasing all over the world. But unfortunately the TCA is quite high, so to get to the point where you can use machines you need to earn enough money to buy them. We saw this start in the west during the 18th and 19th century's, and during the 20th century virtually all manufacturing was automated. If you look at places like China and India, this process happened far more quickly than it did in the west, because the technology was already there, just expensive.

The problem we actually face? By the end of the 20th century places like Britain and the US had got to the point where money was the end goal, not progress. Mainly because we'd beaten the Soviets and no longer had anyone to fight. And since that crashed and burned, we're now facing increased competition from the developing world (which is developing much faster than we realize), and we're going to have a whole new set of challenges to face (such as climate change, food production, energy production and medical care) we will be forced to go back to progress over imaginary money.

"I feel you, OP.

I think it's important to drop the self-judgemental approach we have ingrained in us. We may think that our perceived value is something both really important (isn't) and also generic (isn't either), when value is actually always not only subjective in the sense of individual, but also subject to general context.

One thing that can prevent us from dropping that approach is that it can be hard to accept the irrepairable losses we had and that, and that among them, we may never do anything considered 'successful' in life —not in the eyes we were taught to see through, at least. But we can be our own success, and we must find some pride in that.

You're a survivor of something terrible, and therefore comparing your successes with those of others that may have been luckier on those sides doesn't make sense. In fact, comparing doesn't ever make sense. Life isn't a competition, we all start with different cards.

Regarding hobbies, if I meet someone right now, I don't judge them, I don't want them to show me ""their life's work"". I want to relate to them in the present. What can we do together? Can we have fun, do we have something in common that would make us able to relate under certain pretexts? If yes, good; if not, well too bad, but that doesn't mean nobody is at fault there!

You say you have no real hobbies. You seem to take, too, a success-fail approach at that side of life. You don't have to be successful to have a hobby! You just have to try to have fun doing whatver you enjoy, and then try to relate to those who are having that fun with you. There're plenty of people who enjoy activities where 'success' isn't a thing.

I'm sorry that socialising with your husband's friends is torture to you. Having your own agenda would make it more passable, I think.

"&gt; Whenever a boundary is enforced, they squeal, yell, threaten to kill themselves and do the entire dance. 

This is so true. It's also a sign we are making the best decisions for ourselves.

&gt; Im having a hard time with the enforcement due to fear of that reaction. I'm extremely nonconfrontational and the anxiety that it provokes, destroys me.

You are not the one being confrontational here though. It's not your fault they deal with life by throwing tantrums and other forms of dysfunction. Let them own their crazy, because they were crazy since long before you were born.

&gt; I know I need to get over that hump - would you have any tricks? 

The first trick is a trick of the mind. In particular, it relates to what you believe about their behaviors and tantrums. I don't know if this holds true for all ACONs, although I suspect it does. As children, we fell into a pattern of regulating our behaviors in an attempt to not 'set the narcissist off.' Unfortunately, our attempts to not set the narcissist off, were often reinforced by enablers, because the enablers were being played by a toddler, and wanted us to be the same. Not setting a narcissist off became a survival tactic to make it through our childhood.

As adults, we MUST turn this around. It is FACT we have zero control over the behavior of others. You could no more stop a narcissist from throwing tantrums than you could stop an alcoholic from drinking. In particular, we can't stop crazy people from acting crazy. Are you familiar with cognitive behavioral therapy? It teaches that our emotions flow from our beliefs. So, if we want to change an emotion like anxiety, we must first change our beliefs. I can't help but wonder if your anxiety is the result of believing you can stop the crazy from acting crazy. Since the belief you can control the behavior of another is a FALSE &amp; [distorted belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion), anxiety results from every failure to stop the crazy from  being crazy. In order to change that anxiety &amp; hopefully dissolve it completely, change the belief that you can control the behaviors of the crazy (which is a false belief we carry from childhood) to the factual belief that you have zero control over the behavior of others and your anxiety should dissolve. This means you let them have their tantrums and other dysfunctional responses, because you aknowledge the truth you have zero ability to control how they respond. This truth should set your anxiety free. Their responses are about narcissistic personality disorder anyway, not you, because all you are doing is making decisions best for you, as any other person would do. You are not in the wrong here when they respond with craziness. They are, due to narcissistic personality disorder.

The second trick is setting boundaries in ways such that you limit your exposure to their squealing, yelling, suicide threats and the entire dance. If you block all phone calls from them, it will force them to contact you via either email or text. You then use email or text to inform them of what you will and will not do. If they choose to squeal, yell, threaten suicide or any other part of the dance, you will no longer be exposed to any of that if all communication is via email or text. It's a totally different experience to read their response in text than to hear yelling, stomping their feet, etc. I would go further than that though. I would tone police the emails or text and not respond to emails or texts with angry, hostile, or rude tones, because such communication does not deserve a response from you. Don't reward angry, hostile or rude emails or texts, with a response, because if you do, you are rewarding their bad behavior and training them that type of communication is ok with you. If you go this route with communications with them and stick with it, you will force them into being 'fake nice' with you. They will still be what they are though, only the way they respond to you will change.",,0,dstc96k,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"&gt;*Of course Labour's majority would probably have been lower without Blair in 1997, but I agree with Hattersley that John Smith would still have won handsomely, and the Labour party would have preserved its soul.*

It's interesting that Johnn Smith (if he had not passed away) it's assumed could have taken Labour to winning the General Election instead of Blair.

My question would be, would John Smith's Labour have still done what Blair did:- [We place no trust in those who put their careers above the interest of their nation...](http://www.freebritain.co.uk/gold2.html) 1996, Brighton, Sir James Goldsmith:-

&gt;*Look at* **Tony Blair. In 1983**, *he stated and I quote.. ""We’ll negotiate a withdrawal from the EEC which has drained our natural resources and destroyed jobs"".*

&gt;*But later, the Labour Party changed its tune. I quote*: '""**Labour supports progress towards economic and monetary union...**

&gt;*Blair followed. He said: ""If we want to maintain our global role, we must be a leading player in Europe."""" Pro-Europeans must be persuaders in the debate about Europe's future.""*

Let's add this to the transition between Old Labour and New Labour:-

* Old Labour = Anti-EU, Working-Class, Left-Socialist
* New Labour = Pro-EU (Pro-EURO), Mass immigration as future support base instead of working class, Privatization started under New Labour of NHS etc.

It seems to me the change of Ideology corresponds with the change of stance on the Supranational EU which is super-national-democracy, as per Peter Mandelson (chief Architect of New Labour and EUropean Trade Commissioner:-

"As you're coming out with soundbites I assume you aren't going to listen anyway but heres a guide for everyone else.

&gt;The HRA prevents us from deporting foreigners""

&gt;There is no general prohibition in the HRA on the deportation of non-nationals. If the Government decides that a citizen of another country, who has limited ties to the UK, should no longer be permitted to stay and can be safely sent back to their country of origin, there is nothing in the HRA to prevent this. However, under international human rights law the absolute prohibition on torture prevents countries from sending a person anywhere where there is a substantial risk that the person will be tortured. This is entirely logical. If we abhor torture we must also abhor the outsourcing of torture – if governments were only prohibited from torturing their own citizens but permitted to send people to places of torture, there would be little distinction between deportation and extraordinary rendition. Even before the HRA was enacted the Convention Against Torture, the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights prohibited the UK from deporting people to places of torture.

&gt;Depending on the facts of each individual case, a person’s right to a family life may be interfered with in some cases if deported. Home Office policy is to consider the facts of each case, including the reason for the deportation (i.e. whether a serious or minor offence has been committed), the length of time the person has been in the UK and whether the person has, for example, young children born in the UK or a British spouse. This is the type of balancing exercise that would as a matter of policy be carried out by the Home Office regardless of the HRA, but the HRA has provided greater transparency, accountability and oversight of Home Office decisions in this area.

"Eric Pickles has announced that there is to be an independent investigation headed by Louise Casey, and that she must report back by November at the latest, at which point if the council is found to be in error he may intervene directly.

http://www.amjadbashirmep.co.uk/?p=129

Since they already know that key reports dating back to 2002 and 2003 have gone missing, and recently elected councillors have come forward saying that in light of the recent report they were warned not to raise media  attention to it because it would undermine an ongoing police investigation, it's not looking good for the Labour council.  We now have police saying they were not investigating, with one parent claiming she was told by the police that her 12 year old daughter's rape by five men was 'consensual'.

We also have the former Labour MP who was removed on an unrelated scandal saying that he was told by the Labour party to not draw attention as it was on the back of the race riots.  Who says he could have done more if he hadn't been so much a 'liberal-leftie'.

Now another former MP for Keighley has come forward saying she received the same brush off from the party over concerns of grooming gangs, but that she didn't know it extended to Labour in Rotherham.   

Another councillor in Labour's Wrexham seat was also campaigning for a wider investigation after William Hague closed down the North Wales investigation.

Labour was getting calls from members and representatives across the North and they weren't exposing the bigger picture.  They were actually keeping people in that kept the secret.

Ten years ago Labour's Ann Cryer approached everyone.  Then Home Secretary David Blunkett, the police, social services, local imams.  She was only going on what parents were telling her.  She called for an investigation.    Nothing.

People were coming forward.  They couldn't know for sure or the scale of the problem but they knew something was wrong.  They reported their concerns to the same body.  They all contacted the Labour party.  They were told to shut up.

There is an investigation happening as a matter of emergency, but it is also equally right that the second facet is dealt with and blame is attributed.  Primarily of course we must look to the victims and provide for their needs and make sure the children are safe, their assailants charged.  Secondarily, and not with any less vigour, the Labour party command has to explain how they were receiving all these concerns from multiple sources and how they didn't act on what was clearly a bigger picture.

"&gt;National sovereignty is not that important any more. 

Well I agree, I'm not a nationalist, but the problem is that we are moving towards a world united not for the freedom of the people, but for the freedom of the capital. The EU, for example, encourages privatisation of services and resources, and immigration and free trade, from which the competition is lowering the wages and living conditions for all people as we must compete for employment in the global economy.

&gt;How would you change it? 

The abolition of the Private Monopoly system that allows some to partition the Earth as though they have a God-given right to exclusive control of communal resources. The resources could be managed communally for the benefit of the public by a government run by the people - why should some be able to live in riches just off letting out land and resources they have taken from society?

&gt;I'm not sure why you bring this up so much, given that automation has lead to the most dramatic rises in the quality of life for the human race we've seen.

Because it is creating a fundamental crisis in unemployment, as human labour is just becoming unnecessary. And yet there is no natural law that there must be a job for every citizen, those who are made redundant are abandoned, rather than being educated so they can contribute to society in more meaningful ways. 

The people are treated worse than slaves, for at least a slave, once bought, had a permanent source of sustenance as they were the property of their master, whereas the people constantly face the threat of unemployment and the loss of welfare and sustenance.

&gt;True post-scarcity is hundreds of years away at least.

I agree we are still rather far from it, though in some respects I believe we are reasonably close - in food production, etc. especially for _necessity_ though perhaps not comfort.

But the problem is that this system will never bring us to a post-scarcity society as it depends upon scarcity.

&gt;Again, not sure how you can change this.

As mentioned before, the abolition of the indefensible private monopoly system.

&gt;Necessity is profitable.

Only when those affected have the purchasing power to make it so. The homeless are left homeless because they do not have this power, people die of treatable diseases for the same reason, etc.

The problem with saying that profit will arise as it becomes necessary is that it can easily leave us in a situation where we are past the point of return - take recycling rare metals for example, we don't widely do it at the moment because it is cheaper to just mine for more, however the Earth has only finite resources and so eventually we will have to recycle it, but by the time this becomes a more profitable venture than extending mining, we will have great difficulty in creating the infrastructure to do so.

The reason why I mention Nuclear Fusion research is because it is literally the most important research for the future of mankind. With abundant energy we can easily produce abundant food and water and recycle resources. We should really be putting all our resources in to it now, but instead the capitalist system means we waste human potential on menial labour that could be automated, and leave people uneducated despite the fact it could benefit us all, and as there research is not easy to monetize it fails to attract private investment which makes the funding unstable.

&gt;Capitalism has spread wealth about more than any other system.

What other system has been tried?

The USSR wasn't really socialist, especially after the rise of Stalin, as they basically had the choice between attempting international socialism with the help of the Red Army but risking further wars with the British (keep in mind they almost lost the Civil War due to British intervention), or Stalin could just do 'Socialism in One Country' and be the dictator of his safe nation. Of course, he chose the latter.

Cuba, Venezuala, etc. just show why socialism in one nation can never work.

This system is built upon the same foundations as the feudal system - the private ownership of communal land and resources.

Besides, how do you regulate the market fairly? Without the same market forces shaping the regulation?

I disagree that this system is necessary, in fact I think we could achieve much greater production and advancement if we had a socialist system where we could work to automate the majority of the work, remove the patent system, and provide free education for all to fully utilise the human potential available.",,0,c185iyh,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Ah, but that depends on WHY it is alienating half the population.

Let's assume as a hypothetical (just by way of example and probably not true) that the military is unable to attract women because it is too aggressive and violent and most women don't want to viewed that way. There would be nothing wrong with the military being that way, since that is the entire purpose of the armed forces. Removing the aggression and violence defeats the point of having a group of people whose job it is to go out and kill people. In that case, the proper solution to get more women into the military would be getting women to embrace violence and aggression as admirable traits to embody.

"&gt;There isn't a single movement out there that aims to deal with all issues (not even all issues related to all genders)

I disagree with you here. I would say that moral philosophy and ethics are the base to discussions of gender equality. What I mean by that; If people have fundamentally different moral/ethical beliefs there can simply be no progress towards equality for men and women.
It seems that in many instances MRAs and Feminists are both arguing from an Egalitarian point of view, but can't agree as they apply the idea (Egalitarianism) differently, or make different assumptions about the other's position. 

e.g. Equality in the workplace - does that refer to equality of opportunity or equality of outcome? If one has leanings towards a socialist (perhaps communist) political ideology, equality of outcome (in, say, the form of gender quotas) might not seem like a particularly controversial ethical question. Whereas, one who has unshakable faith in capitalist ideology might passionately believe in equality of opportunity, but find the idea of quotas abhorrent and fundamentally non-egalitarian. 
Both might be arguing for gender equality from broadly the same philosophical perspective, but their disagreement in one area of Egalitarian philosophy and political/economic beliefs will need to be adressed and pinned down before they can make any meaningful contribution to the gender equality debate.

Rather than finger pointing and I-told-you-so's being hurled back and forward in regards to specific points on either side of the discussion, it would seem to me to be far more effective to try and understand one another's moral/ethical/political philosophical standpoints in general. No one's opinion can be dismissed unless their argument is fundamentally flawed logically, and to know this we must understand exactly where they are coming from and how they arrived at their conclusion. So, trying to deal with women's or men's rights issues without looking at the other is completely futile in my opinion.",,0,caa224b,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

This is the key here.

The constant stream of misogynist humor and lazy rape jokes (which are almost always predicated on a pathetically mundane play on the audience's expectations, so even from a comedic standpoint they're weak) only shows us that comedians as a whole are unwilling to take the issue seriously.

And before anyone starts in with the tired nonsense about ""They're *comedians*! They're not *supposed* to take anything seriously!"" let me say: Seriously? You *really* believe that? You think that the greatest comedy minds of the last century, like Bill Hicks and Richard Pryor and George Carlin and Steve Martin and Gilda Radner didn't take anything seriously?

"When I hear a woman, particularly a white and cis woman, talk about feminism in this way I can't help but roll my eyes.

"&gt;Right, but as Bertrand Russell said in his message to people 1000 years from now, we need to learn to live with each other and accept differing viewpoints. That means not legally forcing people to do what we want because we disagree with them, however wrong they might seem to be.

1000 years from now?

Anyway, I completely agree.  Whilst I may not agree with people and their ethics, does not mean I want new laws put in to 'protect' the people.  (A previous comment used the law that are already in place).

&gt;I disagree here though. You know what? I'm fine with it being legal to have ""No blacks"" or ""No men"" on a door, if everyone can do it. Now while this is illegal I'll object to there being exceptions for some groups, but overall as long as it's for everyone, I'm fine with it. The reason? If my corner shop sticks up a ""no blacks"" sign, that's fine, that is their right. I'll just stop going there (and I ain't black).

I get what you mean, and in linking with the article it fits in.  And yes, whilst this is true, doing so in today's society with be suicide for a business which is why this doesn't happen.  Only a minority, I hope, would still use the shop.

&gt;People have this idiotic idea that if you allow for discrimination legally that nothing can ever be done against it. They look to the government and the state to solve social and moral problems instead of getting up off their fat lazy immoral asses and walking 5 minutes more to the next shop over in the interests of not supporting people they don't agree with.

Totally with you on this point.  But it seems people look to the government for help and protection from anything, such as Twitter.  Do we really need such harsh laws over people disputing over twitter.  They have a function to block people from commenting (I think?), so why don't people do this instead of getting all twisted and annoyed by people saying stuff that may be morally wrong, but is nothing but pixels shaped into words.

The more that people want protected from morally wrong things, the less freedom is given to the people.  We now have to watch our words, watch what we say, watch how we talk, incase some small offence is taken and then a shit storm could occur.

So yes, I am in agreement that the government and police should not be there for every little disagreement, and people should sort their own damn problems out by showing it with their money (for shops) and their voice (for speech).

&gt;But your average person now, that's not good enough, they shouldn't have to walk to the next shop over because they disagree with the one nearby, the government should force that one nearby to live by their morals...cos...y'know...it's convenient.

That's still 11% below the 50% mark and frankly I'm pretty impressed that you can get it up to 39%, but it will depend on what you spend it on I suppose and it's probably a good indication that you are earning a decent income.

&gt;Is it acceptable? I don't know I have many mixed feelings about it.

I think we all do, paying taxes isn't exactly fun, I remember being in my 20's and getting a rather large bonus, including a mass of overtime after having spent a few months working essentially all hours, not seeing my family (and very young son at the time)  and then watching what felt like a very large proportion be passed straight to the state. Since then (and a few A&amp;E visits with kids,  a re-prioritisation of what is important in my life and so on..) and I realise that it was probably perfectly reasonable and actually, even if it had been higher, it would have been justifiable.

&gt;When I saw people I knew getting benefits, a house to live and everything else

This is the problem though isn't it.  I mean, I worked from 14 (whilst at school - Woolworths and then a factory) onwards.  I didn't go to college or university because I couldn't afford to (and instead paid for others to go..) but did perfectly well without it. I haven't claimed unemployment benefits and I have never had access to council housing. It's been hard at times too, and frankly there are times I really wish I'd made some different choices (but hey, 20/20 hindsight and all that).  Yet I don't think I ever really objected to people getting benefits, even housing when needed, I would have liked to think that if anything went tits up for me, that support would be there.  

What is annoying and what does need to be changed though, is not the benefits, but the criteria.  I support people getting access to money to ensure that they can survive and live a moderately decent life.  I do have a problem with the excess of support that goes to the wrong people, the criteria for things like free school meals is absurd some of the time, access to hardship funding often has more to do with how much you know, rather than who is in need.  

In short, I think we do need to spend money to equalise opportunity, we need to make sure that there is a good, safety net that offers more than the bare minimum, we need to pay for it through taxation, but we also need to make sure that the priorities are right.

In addition, spending money isn't universally ""good"". What, exactly, do you propose people spend their money on? A lot of essential items, like food, are already quite cheap. Others, like housing, do not increase in supply in reponse to increase deman (actually nothing does). In fact most people spend too much any way, especially poor people. Overspending for anyone but the rich incurs debt. And debt destablizes economies. So we really should do more to curb spending.

Demand Management like this is meant to reduce load on the grid during peak times, and avoid the use of ['peaking' power stations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaking_power_plant). The plans referred to in the article are to allow back-up generators to reduce demand during times when these peaking power stations would normally come online, which would be for less than 1% of the year. In the UK these have generally been either oil or coal fired, among the dirtiest power stations in the country. This makes sense for the national grid, because it reduces the need to have major generating plant sitting idle for most of the year, and it makes sense for the hospital, because as a major electricity consumer they gain the financial benefits of managing their demand.

Compared to other energy sources in the UK, renewables are neither expensive nor unreliable. The increased risk of blackouts we're facing is due to a lack of willingness from energy utilities to install new generating plant, which is in part due to a lack of clarity in the energy policies of successive governments. 

We've known that this was coming for a long time, but no-one in a position of leadership has been willing to step up and do something about it. If there had been a consistent approach to supporting renewables over the last 10 years, then we probably wouldn't be facing an energy gap now, but making that call would have pissed off a lot of people. Renewables are still the fastest-growing energy source in the UK, and should be able to fill most of the gap if their growth continues, but we won't be able to build enough other energy generation from other sources in time, which is why we need to consider plans such as the one addressed in this article.

I don't know whether this is a lack of law or just a matter of technicalities (like all complex things, it is probably both).  But it is clearly not working.

"&gt;From my perspective, the most interesting thing about the Hayekian and Austrian claims is how little they trust the market. We build 1.25 million houses instead of 1 million houses for three years because we mistakenly think that the cost of capital and the risk-bearing capacity of the market is higher than it really is. We recognize our mistake. The market then has to shift resources out of construction and into other forms of activity.

&gt;It should do so smoothly. Prices of houses fall. Construction workers on piece rates conclude they could make more money retaining for other occupations. The market takes care of it. This is what markets are good at. This is why we like markets rather than command-and-control.

&gt;But no, the Austrians say, instead of a smooth shift we need to render 1.5 million construction workers idle, render an additional 6 million workers in other industries idle, and keep them that way for four years.

This is from the conclusion of that piece.  And I agree with what he is saying.  Prices of things should fall, workers should train for other occupations, the market should take care of it.

Instead of letting housing prices fall, they think we should pump liquidity into the market to try to drive down interest rates and get people to buy more houses.

"&gt;This is not fluff; it's Economics 101.

And most of modern ""Econ 101"" is nonsense. (The typical Econ textbook doesn't even get the operation of banking correct; but rather continues to propound obsolete myths.)

&gt;&gt;taken at its root, it is a claim that ""demand"" is basically driven by government spending.

&gt;This is not the basic claim. The basic claim is that in the current environment, where consumers are debt-constrained, where short-term interest rates are near zero percent, and where an exchange-rate adjustment is not feasible, budgets deficits in the public sector are filling the demand gap left by the housing collapse. Again, this is Economics 101.

Oh, LOL.  You poor boy.  You just restated (in lots of obfuscatory words) the same thing that I said... what is hilarious is that you don't realize it (your obfuscation is mainly deluding yourself).

&gt;To assert that demand is always driven by the government would be absurd. Once every 80 years, though, the government does play an important role in driving demand.

LOL.

And once every 80 years -- when this is tried again -- we AGAIN experience a decade+ long depression. (Rather than a short recession and a natural clearing.)

&gt;This is a valid criticism. However, it's really difficult to squander tax money in the current environment. With real interest rates negative across most of the curve, the government doesn't even need to find positive ROI projects to spend the money on for the spending to be worthwhile.

Difficult to squander? My you are naive.

And ""doesn't even need to find positive ROI projects"" -- basically you are claiming (as I noted) that more EATING (negative ROI) will somehow ""fix"" the problem.

&gt;All spending on education obviously does not produce a high return. But investments in early childhood education do typically produce high returns. This is one area where the money could be spent.

Ah, but a) that is NOT what you stated; and b) past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Putting a little bit of fertilizer around plants is helpful; dumping a truckload around a single tree will often simply kill the plant.

It is this ""we need to do something... here's something... let's do that"" mentality -- that is (as you have reinforced) entirely ""careless of ROI"" (the *government doesn't even need to find positive ROI projects* which implies ""negative ROI"" is acceptable, and that you think no one even need be concerned about ROI... just ""spend spend spend"", and some ""magic"" will happen, as if the spending and consumption are magical pixie dust).

&gt;There is no doubt that Siegel is a hard worker. But all of the economic literature on entrepreneurship suggests that Siegel's success is, in large part, due to luck. He could have easily ended up like the millions of other entrepreneurs who failed and ended up broke.

Well, then your ""economic literature"" is (as I have pointed out) nonsensical.

Ever hear the story about the guy who wanted to become a chicken farmer?  He plowed his field correctly, added what he thought was the proper amount of fertilizer, made certain he cultivated the fields to keep the weeds down, but no matter how many eggs he planted, he didn't get any chickens to grow.  I guess he was just ""unlucky"".

Point is, that if you think the ONLY (or even the MAIN) component of entreprenuerial success is ""luck"" then you need to get your arse OUT into the real world and learn a few things about reality.

I think to understand the present/future we need to have a better understanding of the past. At one point in our history women were seen as nothing more than property. Everything women did or done was regulated to them by their fathers, brothers, uncles, or husbands. They had no free will, rights, or protection. This ranged from making their own money, voting, holding property, and contraception rights. Throughout different times in history women and men alike fought for women to have these basic human rights.

The simple answer to your question boils down to the fact that women can give birth and men can’t. Its women who have to, in essence, do all the hard work. This is not saying that women automatically make better parents, or that men can’t or don’t love their children as much as or more than women. It has to do with the rights of the person, in this case women, who have to make most of the sacrifices. Women since they carry most of the burden of birthing should be able to choose if and when they have children. Yes, I think that men should be able to have a say, but at the end of the day its women who have to make the decision.

I don't think that makes sense at all. To compete on costs with the likes of China, the average wage would need to drop to somewhere around £0.50 per hour. That's hardly going to keep us in the style to which we've become accustomed or make much of  a dent in our debts. 

Instead, we need to extend our niche in high margin, specialist goods and services. 

To make this happen will require sweeping changes to education and mindset. We can't keep on staffing British industry with skilled people from Eastern Europe while Brits remain unskilled, uneducated and on the dole. 

Mindset will be a bigger problem than education because it can't be mandated or facilitated by government. Historically the British upper classes have looked down on the people who actually make or do stuff, and there has been endless conflict between owners and employees. Nowadays there's a widespread contempt for people who work and study hard to improve their skills. 

We probably need to get a bit more entrepreneurial as well. The good news is that government might be able to help a bit here: for example [Paul Graham thinks the state may be able to buy a Silicon Valley](http://www.paulgraham.com/maybe.html).

Paradoxically making people hungrier and leaner doesn't help much with this. Apart from a few exceptional people, the threat of penury simply discourages risk taking. In my own case, without free health care and some sort of welfare state to fall back on, I would never have had the balls to start my own business.

"I agree with you. Civil liberties are an important issue for me in this election and one of the main reasons why I will vote lib dem. 

The 'nothing to hide' argument is a red herring. The object of power is power - those who are in power will always try to obtain more power and thus we must in turn try to restrict them as much as possible. To make them serve us as part of the social contract that sees us cede taxes and some rights. 

Many of the systems we use to restrict power have ended up broken (consider financing of elections in the US - an obscene corruption of politics) - although many still function to a greater or lesser degree - such as the judiciary and rule of law and to some extent the media. 

The democratic process of electing government is just one of these mechanisms to restrict power and in the UK and US it is profoundly broken - the two party system has led to corruption, moral bankruptcy and intellectual torpor. We call 'change change!' but we need to see the political system as power inputs and outputs - where money or upbringing can buy you influence of power, we must redesign to restrict this influence.

The two most significant events of our generation - the war on terror and the bailout of the banks - show you far more about politics than any leaders debate or Presidential speech.

1. That international politics is governed by real politik, not rule of law

2. That the inducement (or fear) of money can and does buy you power

"&gt; Who owns the debt? If it is owned by the UK public or the UK private sector (or even the treasury) then it means that whilst the Government is in debt, it is being financed by the UK anyway. Most Government debt tends to sit in pension funds.

Regardless of who owns the debt, we still have to service it as failing to do so will have dire consequences for future borrowing. And it's the cost of servicing the debt which is going to impact us the most going forward. Already it stands at £45B a year, and will rise to £60B by the end of this parliament.  This is a lot of money that we could be putting to better use so we should be cautious about raising it more than is necessary.

&gt; Are the cuts affecting our ability to grow revenue for the government? I'd argue they are contributing to it - we've been stagnant in our growth for over a year now. If we had a large increase in tax revenue (caused by increase in taxation, increase in pay, increase in output, however you want to look at it) we would be able pay back a deficit much more easily. We're stuck in a our deficit is £Xbn rather than our deficit is x% of our income.

The issue here as I see it is that we need to ensure that the growth gained from a stimulus spending program exceeds the cost of the borrowing required to do so. And quite frankly, given geo-econonmic conditions it's very hard to see how this would happen at the moment. Once things have settled down it might be viable, but atm I don't think it is.

"&gt; I actually do believe that once everyone (individuals and nations) can get their debts to a manageable level, we will see a return of demand in the marketplace to drive the economy forward.

Yes. Recessions don't last forever, and this is how balance-sheet recessions end: after a grindingly slow process, people get their debts down to where they want them and start spending again. Also, if you wait long enough people's durable goods (which they have been delaying replacing as part of their debt-reduction strategy) start to wear out, *forcing* them to spend money. That's another way recessions end on their own.

But here's the thing: 

1. The decade (or so) of suffering we need to go through before things get back to normal is pointless. We can end the recession through active macroeconomic management (some combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus). Why waste a decade for nothing?

2. A very prolonged period of high unemployment does permanent, structural damage to the economy by having people's skills erode away through inactivity. If someone can't find a job for 3 years, their productivity is permanently lower from that experience compared to if they had a job.

"Actually, that's the primary goal of non-profit insurance companies.

What do you think subsidized industry accomplishes? It is able to run at a net-loss all whilst increasing the demand for medical care (especially when you add in the massive bureaucracy government will hire to run it). This increased demand influenced by unnatural advantage is a competitive pressure on natural health-care insurance companies, which may possibly be unable to compete considering the states mandate what their plans must provide (they are mostly unable to reduce costs by offering cheaper plans that don't cover as much). The end result is competition is reduced and without competition prices go up.

Since the demand for healthcare insurance has increased due to the subsidized offering, healthcare costs begin to rise (what the doctors charge the insurance companies, including, the public option). This is the crux of the issue, and, the large problem with insurance-based healthcare. A coercive government can curb this natural effect by pricefixing, however, that entails its own problems.


I honestly believe the only way to reach the most efficient, free, and cheap healthcare possible -- we need to put to death the concept that insurance should pay for everything. People need to pay out of their pocket for trivial non-er visits, and only then will they realize how costs have risen.

"Years ago, I had a friend who was a couple weeks into a new relationship. We were out with a group of women, all of us around 20 years old, and a guy started chatting to my friend. I don't really drink so I always keep an eye on things when we're out. They're just chatting, she seems fine. Then I overhear him saying he'll get her a drink, a double whiskey. This gets my attention as it's a weird drink to buy a woman who I've never seen drink whiskey.

While he's at the bar, I whisper into her ear asking is she okay, does she want to be chatting with this guy. She says no, but she doesn't know how to get him to back off. When he comes back I announce I need to go to the bathroom and my friend says she does too. 

In the bathroom she tells me he's from the area we live and is related to someone we vaguely know. She reiterates that she doesn't want anything to do with him and wishes her new partner was here. I tell her not to panic, don't drink anything he gives her and when we go back out, we'll hang out with the other women we're there with. 

We do this and the guy is still following my friend around trying to give her this drink. She gives some excuse about remembering she doesn't like whiskey and I chime in with something supportive. Basically I stick to my friend like glue for the night. This guy wants to tell her something? I've just remembered a dramatic thing that happened to me that my friend needs to advise me on. He starts encroaching in her space? My favourite song is on, we need to go dance. Etc. Etc.

At the end of the night, our group is queuing for a taxi and this guy is still with us. He keeps saying he's going the same direction as us so he should hop in. I keep saying there won't be space, he should get one with his friends instead. He tries to get my friend's number, I can't remember whether she gave him a fake number or refused. Our taxi pulls up, it's a people carrier. Our group get in and this guy tries to get in too. I tell him no, get his own taxi. He's still arguing with me. I end up having to close the door in his face. The taxi driver asks is he with us. We all say no. He drives off.

To this day, my friend says if I hadn't been there, she doesn't know what would happen because she never knew how to say no to a guy when technically speaking he hadn't suggested anything yet. She didn't want to make a scene or make him angry.

In this context we are talking about how to define gender when it comes to sports.

So while technically correct in other contexts I find it disingenuous to use the term ""cis woman"" in the context of sports where gender definitions are binary and have gaping undefined holes, where Semenya falls.

The whole argument is that we need to decide how to define genders better in sports so that controversies like Semenya won't happen.

Saying that she is a cis woman and not mentioning any of the intersex issue is misleading even if it is technically correct.

And for all other sense and purposes she is a woman but when it comes to sports we don't have clear enough definitions to say it clearly one way or the other.

Do you immediately run over to the third party and relate what was said, as we must have no secrets? Can you honestly see people working together if there was such honesty?

"&gt;A better idea would be to give reparations to all disenfranchised parties, including but not limited to all racial minorities, the poor, disabled and LGBT community.

While this might make a reparations proposal more ""big tent-y"" and turn more people into supporters (if only out of self-interest), it misses the point of the reparations movement. Sure, it's really sucked at points in history to be in the United States and a member of any of dozens of disfavored or politically-weak minority groups. And it still sucks today for a non-trivial number of them. 

However, the argument for reparations goes, oppression of African Americans was (and is) *uniquely* pervasive, longstanding, unjustifiable, comprehensive, and backed by government power that the negative effects transcend generations and will continue to compound indefinitely into the future unless serious steps are made now, not only to stop the oppression, but to affirmatively reverse it.

Saying, ""we need to provide reparations for other groups"" is kind of like replying to the #blacklivesmatter activism with ""no, all lives matter"". It's not that you're *wrong* -- all lives do indeed matter, and African Americans aren't the only group that has suffered significant oppression -- but you're missing the point. The reparations movement (and #blacklivesmatter) is about raising awareness of the unique difficulties that blacks in the US have had and continue to have.

So, maybe other groups are deserving of reparations from the USFG too, but those reparations (1) would likely be significantly different in kind or amount than reparations that make African Americans whole and (2) should have their own independent discussion because of the unique ways that the USFG has been terrible to various groups over the years.",,0,cud1lhs,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

"Yes, I think these are all pretty ubiquitous in terms of intent, but I feel quite modern in terms of their application. Here's a few tweaks to what I would probably apply:

&gt;More support for science. (We don’t listen to it enough)

Yes, but I'd like to advance on this a little bit. I think the UK needs to have a more 'reddit' approach to STEM subjects: we need to advocate it as the way forward; treat it as something open that anyone can take a part of and learn from; not treat it like some kind of evil witchcraft when it goes wrong or deus ex-machina salvation that will save us in 5 years (TM); and we also need to be a bit more quantitative and objective with our approach to political problems. We're all promise and no proportion in so many cases. We're always saying 'no enough' or 'too much' and not 'here is the amount that there is, make up your own mind whether that is too much'.

&gt;Massive change in way we use energy/create energy. Carbon neutrality. (Push for renewables, there’s lots of things the government could push for.)

This is laudable but not necessarily practical. I think we should definitely push for it, but also should be realistic about the challenges that we will have to face. I've had long conversations with a few physicists about this, and the only one who really convinced me was the advocate of nuclear power. This isn't a very popular option, but it is actually a decent solution that shouldn't be brushed aside due to superstition etc. But yes, logic and reason and all that should lead the way.

&gt;Creation of carbon sinks (Even if it’s just stuff like rooftop gardens etc.)

I went to Nottingham recently and saw some good designs for carbon sinks in the Chem Eng department. Suffice to say that people are working on this problem. The main issue will of course be getting it to be commercially viable which may not be as much of an issue as the phrase 'must be commercially viable' normally suggests. But yes, this is what I would consider a 'solution' to what I was saying above when I said 'actually solving problems'.

&gt;Conservation (This would be more aimed worldwide.)

Yes, I think we can all get behind that one. I think we'd have to be more specific eventually on where we would want to go with it, though. As a political party we should have Britain's interests at heart first and foremost.

&gt;More equality (Rich should support the poor more than they do.)

Easy to say, tricky to do. I don't think anybody is going to be able to force anybody to stop being bastards (looking at you, bankers), but certainly if we got more support then we would advocate and be vocal on treating your workers with *some* respect, not putting profits over safety or hygiene standards and just generally taking a small hit in the margins for being a stronger company overall. There are some good Simon Sinek talks on this (creative mornings is a good one).

&gt;Closing tax loopholes for companies (Keep seeing those things where starbucks or some company paid 2% tax etc.)

I think being more open with the law and encouraging more of a public understanding and participation in it. Law at the moment is very dull. So very very dull dull dull. And we're expecting normal people to have an interest in it and make decisions about it! This stuff is read less than the bible and is several times the length. Most of the time people go by a 'well if this isn't hurting anyone then it's probably legal' which is a pretty good rule of thumb, but shows a certain failure in the system that we don't actually know what's expected of us by society. Can we make law feel more reasonable and fair? Probably, but it would take a metric tonne of work. I'd certainly look into some kind of legal github and crowdsourcing to close these sorts of problems. Clay Shirky did a great TED talk on this.

&gt;Legalising most drugs. (Would bring in a lot of money and cut crime, MDMA, LSD, Marijuana etc. are all less dangerous (probably) than alcohol and tobacco anyway) (N.B I’ve smoked marijuana about 4 times in my life and done MDMA twice, I’m not someone who wants this for their own benefit. I just think it makes sense)

Steady on there, chief. For a start I think that the UK has a bit more of a culture problem with drugs than some parts of the US, but that isn't to say that the law couldn't be improved in this area. For example, the Daily Mail (which reflects the views, albeit shitty ones, of a good chunk of British people) would have a huge issue with a policy on just making weed legal. I can probably see it going back down to class C, but I wouldn't want to push it too hard as something I personally strongly believe in. Something to look at in the future!

&gt;Better support for jobless (push for ability to create loans to help people move to places where there are jobs. I figure lack of mobility must account for a surprisingly high proportion of unemployment, especially amongst graduates.)

Interesting problem. I think that social support should be encouraged but maybe a solution like loans isn't the answer. I guess it would be something to look at at a later date, but in the meantime have a more general 'we support taking action to help people get jobs' would suffice in the mean time. As far as politics goes I wouldn't want to make a decision on that until I knew what resources I had at my disposal to tackle the problem anyway: probably not enough for anything drastic or it would have been done already.

&gt;Reducing British military spending/change the way as a nation we behave internationally. (I think we spend too much here, could be better used elsewhere. We also think we're a far bigger power than we should really think we are.)

I wouldn't want to really comment too much on current foreign policy, but I think that some of the cool things that are being done by the military should be more well-known. We have a bit of a problem in the UK that we have a large military bill, but don't have much of a breakdown (in a readily available public repository) of where any of the money that the government is spending is going. The internet has meant that we now no longer NEED to have the chancellor announcing the budget from the doorstep of number 10, we could get that shit delivered into out lap in a digested and easy to understand format! I love some of the Telegraph Matt cartoon where the couple are simultaneously terrified and bored at the budget. Military is a part of this.

&gt;Proportional Representation (It’s just fairer, surely.)

Yes, I think so. It's worth watching some of the CGP Grey videos on youtube about voting. Even AV would be a little bit of a step forward. Also I would make it a policy that if we ever did the AV thing again, this time we actually argue for why it is and isn't a good idea rather than both sides slinging truckloads of grade A bullshit at each other. That election was an embarrassment, not because of the result but just because it is some of the worst campaigning I think I have ever seen in my life.

&gt;Change the way teaching happens. (Not sure how quite because I’ve never given it great thought but something needs doing.)

Yeah, I think teaching is heading in the right direction but I agree it needs improving. I think an important part of this would be to look after our teachers better. They get a pretty raw deal at the moment, and these are the people that are inspiring the next generation as we speak.

&gt;Increased minimum wage.

I guess? I discussed this with one of the managers at a well-known theme park that I worked at. He was discussing how the company *could* pay more than minimum wage for its labour, but when you apply the budget across how many people it would affect, in practice you're most likely to get each person gaining 5p an hour. I don't know how this would apply to raising national standards, but I would think a priority should be in changing attitudes towards staff before actually changing the legislation that deals with it.

&gt;Listen to experts more, I’m never going to be an expert in everything, so frankly why are so many decisions seemingly made by people who aren't.
And like I said, if someone can show me good research that means these things shouldn't be done or moreso better ideas/opinions then I will change my mind in a flash. And I want a party that would do that as well. Eventually people would learn it's a sign of strength not weakness.

Couldn't agree with this more. More people who know what they're talking about, and more people who know what they're talking about explaining it in a way that is open and informative. I feel too often that explanations are reductive and patronising. This really needs to be tightened up, not just in politics but across the board in my opinion.

Thanks. That's exactly the point I was trying to make. We don't make many efforts to make healthcare fast and cheap because there isn't a lot of reason to. The buyer (patient) doesn't care about the price because they never know what it is. The medical establishment is happy charging exorbitant rates. There's minimal incentive to be competitive on costs, except when the providers negotiate with insurance companies and that causes monopsony problems. 

There's also Defensive Medicine which we need to find some reasonable way to curtail.

"To deviate slightly from your question in order to provide a fuller answer I believe that each child should be taught and helped to achieve skills that they are able to. The education system fails pretty much everyone at the moment, the bright and clever children are typically held back, the slower and less clever children are generally dragged along even when they are clearly struggling.

Ideally I would like teachers and teaching assistants to spend more time one-2-one with students to help them at the level they need. The Khan Academy software shows how this kind of specialisation might be done in the future.

There is no reason that such classifications should be permanent but should change to reflect the changes to the individual. That we have people leaving school without even basic maths and English skills suggests that we need to more for those at the bottom.

I've met many people who in later life went through adult education and then to university and are doing very well, for one reason or another the schooling system failed them. Economically such failure is too high to ignore, we need to make sure we get schooling right the first time round.

Furthermore, we do attach too much value to a degree when no degree is really required, we do need more vocational training and it does need to be seen as a serious proposition for those that leave school but also for employers. As valuable as education is in its own right we need to remember that for many an education is only a means to an end - i.e. getting a (better) job. ",,0,c3cjshc,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"&gt;Very rarely do I hear the caveat that what we need to spend it on must be productive.

Possibly because it's nonsensical. Why would people go out of their way to add the ""caveat"" that it must be productive. That's like saying, *I hear people talk about building these aero-planes all the time, but they never mention the caveat that they need to not fall out of the sky.*

Krugman, I very much doubt, would back the totally useless spending plan. What he's saying in that context is that *compared to terrible stagnation*, spending money metaphorically digging ditches can be good for the economy, because it's a way of getting more of the monetary supply into the hands of the poor, working, and middle classes. **That** is what I've heard Krugman rest on, and it makes sense to me.

You can be totally right that this ""useless spending"" doesn't amount to any final product that has improved the economy, but many people believe a big part of the problem with the economy right now is that most of the economy's money is crunched up at the very top in a very few hands. Much of the nation is in tight or desperate economic circumstances, which means they don't have extra cash to go around spending on goods and services.

If a bunch of unemployed people were able to dig ditches and get paid, they could use that money to buy healthy food, health insurance, improvements to their home/car, education for themselves or their children. If there were a lot of people now spending money on those types of services, then the economy would be able to take off. The rich could now invest their money in profitable ventures, rather than sitting on it and anxiously waiting to see what direction the economy is going to move in. With more money in the hands of this nation's base, the rich ""job creators"" will be able to see enough economic demand beneath them to actually create new jobs to profit off meeting the new demand.

After the economy is out of its rut, the notion is you can cut back on the ditch digging, since those ditch diggers ought to be able to find a real job in a healthy economy.

"Respectfully, reading up on this author, she has a staunch libertarian perspective in her writing.   While certainly we should examine the article and what it's saying we should also examine the views of the author as it pertains to evidence presented as these do indicate bias in her works.   It's important to recognize that we may not be getting balanced writing from a journalist who is openly a free market libertarian.

So we do need some balance.   We certainly need to encourage the profit motive to create new housing and we need to balance that against the social impact of allowing uncontrolled rental increases.

A landlord knows for example that moving is a pain in the ass, and that a tenant will accept a premium on their rent that's non zero in order to avoid being forced to move.   Ergo having some controls in place discouraging landlords from taking advantage is relevant.  I am a landlord btw.    My tenant currently pays me $1000/mo.   Rents in the area are now $1200/mo.   It's reasonable I should be allowed to push rent up at some rate of inflation.   However if left unchecked I could probably raise their rent to $1250/mo and they'd probably suck it up.  However all landlords could take advantage and thus drive up housing costs aggressively.  Especially where I live that has a 0.1% vacancy rate.   

As usual we need to balance social impact.   Landlords have one motive: profit.   I didn't build my suite for charity.   However I do need to be kept under measured control.   Conversely I shouldn't be forced to contend with sub market rates forever.   I have good long term tenants and I'm fine with the money I receive but certainly would be happy with more too.

"I'll give it a shot. First, let's talk about money itself. We use ""fiat money"" or money that isn't backed by anything except trust in the issuing institution. That means that the institution is able to create as much of it as they wish; however, they have incentive to not keep creating it (if they make too much it becomes less valuable). It is important to know that when you control money you have this option, though.

In a monetary union, multiple entities band together and decide to ""create"" money at the same rate based on rules that they all set (this is what the EU is [euro] and the US [dollar]). In a fiscal union, the entities band together and decide together how they spend their collective money (think the federal government in America, Europe has no institution like that).

Now, let's talk about Greece, our spotlighted country. They have driven themselves into default by spending money recklessly. Because the Eurozone has no fiscal authority, they were allowed to do this (unlike the individual States in America). Normally (when you aren't in a currency union), you are faced with recession. You can tackle this fiscally (increasing spending to jumpstart the economy - not really an option for a government strapped for cash) or monetarily (you can pump money into the system, lowering the value of the currency overall, in order to both increase investment through a decrease in interest rates and increase exports [because your stuff is cheaper and prices take a long time to change]). 

However, with Greece headed into recession, out of money, and without control over their own currency, all of these options were effectively impossible. Only thing they could was attempt to convince the European Central Bank to attempt something akin to Quantitative Easing to push money into the economy (which is now happening across Europe, too little, too late).

Why couldn't they convince the ECB to do this earlier? Greece needed a specific type of money (cheap, pumped into the economy) in order to get out of the recession. Germany and the other ""economically sound"" nations did NOT want this (they don't want to spur needless inflation after the terror of the 1920s).

This is why a currency union is nearly impossible without a fiscal union. With the fiscal union, you can attempt to spend evenly so that each area requires the same ""type"" of money and the currency union can effectively provide that money. In the EU (or any currency union without a fiscal union), the countries can spend money in wildly different ways and require wildly different kinds of money - but there is only one Euro for everyone.",,0,cskyo2q,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pretty much let them know what a shitty individual they at every opportunity are for years and decades.

"Um, wow.  The stupid, it burns.  Okay, lets look at the mechanism at work, here.  The AGW chicken littles say that increased CO2 in the atmosphere will capture more IR radiating from the ground than it did before, then almost immediately release it in a random direction.   Since some of that newly redirected IR goes back to the ground, it will reduce the amount of rate at which energy is released to space via radiation from the ground.  This results in a warmer surface, which then warms the air because the air touches the ground.

The glass we use (in skyscrapers and greenhouses) generally blocks IR.  That's one of the features of the glass.  So, because glass generally blocks the IR, it can't get into the building to make the inside of the building hotter.

Well, there you have it.  He claims that buildings with windows account for 60% of all human emissions.  Odd, because the numbers that I've seen show that 32% come from transportation and something like 34% comes from electrical energy production, which is over 60%, and a large part of what's left is agricultural.  I suppose he could mean that the buildings use most of the energy, but really, it's not the windows that use the energy, it's activities that go on inside the buildings.  An empty building sitting there without the power turned on does not emit much CO2.

Why should the heavyness of an object have anything to do with God's ability to lift it?

OK, here's another way to think about it: if god creates a really heavy object, then he can also create another object that's heavier, and he then just lets gravity do its business, and the heavier object will pull the less heavy object.

There's no such thing as an object so heavy that God can't lift, just like there's no such thing as the largest possible integer.

Can God create the largest possible integer?

No.

"One of the things we have to unlearn and re-learn is precisely that, now that we're adults, we're the only ones who decide what and how we're allowed to feel and not. As how it should always have been. That's actually the only way to get to know ourselves and learn to behave socially, taking into account our feelings. But alas, when we carry that kind of trauma, we're stuck, and we may need a little push or help to push for ourselves.

Also, generally, people telling others how they should feel is a toxic behavior. Unfortunately, it's also very common, as not everyone has the empathy and abilities to deal with someone else feeling in a certain way. It could be said that we need to see and choose with whom we can show certain parts of ourselves, as in, only a very few close relationships will be tolerant with that. One way to see it is that if you've ever dealt successfully with someone who was feeling in a certain way, they may reciprocrate.

Also, feelings are always true. We either feel like something or not. It's the rest, that can make them appropiate or not in a certain moment, in a certain context, or towards certain persons. But negating them is no help.

Instead, it's the beliefs that may be challenged. For that, see Albert Ellis' ABC model, where he proved that upon an event (A), the beliefs/scenario (B) will determine how we feel (C). So if we want to change how we feel, we need to change how we think.",,0,dqqrgsn,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

"Well, we have yet to discover some higher being, so we have to work with what knowledge we've got.  I agree anything constructed by humans is fallible. We are not ""perfect"", if there is such a thing. But what I mean by *objective* in this sense, is that it doesn't matter what one specific individual believes. 

This definition: not influenced by personal feelings, interpretations, or prejudice; based on facts; unbiased:

Logic indicates that it's morally wrong to do something to someone if you would not want them to do that same thing to you, absent some reasonable justification. I don't deny that morals are for the most part subjective and determined by societies and individuals. However, I believe that there are moral principles that are true regardless of what any human society or individual thinks. For example, the so called ""golden rule"". These main principles are the starting point, the default indicator of right and wrong. 

To wrap this up, let's bring it back to veganism again. I can tell you my thought process. I saw evidence of how animals are treated in the animal agriculture industry. I recognized, ""this is wrong"", those animals experience immense suffering. I did more research, and discovered that eating animal products is not necessary in a healthy human diet. So at this point I either had to ignore this and live with the cognitive dissonance, or justify my eating animal products despite knowing that it's wrong.  Through more research, I learned that veganism is not that difficult to transition to, and there were even some benefits that I wasn't aware of. There were some negative impacts to me, because I used to enjoy the taste of meat, dairy, and eggs, and social situations became more complex. Ultimately, (over the course of months) I decided that those negatives were nowhere near enough to morally justify using animal products.

I honestly don't know the last time I read either of those periodicals. Certainly it hasn't been on purpose.

But look - seriously - speciesism isn't some bizarre made up concept. It's just the idea that being human is a good enough reason for human-animals to have greater moral rights than non-human-animals; it's just a prejudice or bias in favour of the interests of members of one's own species and against those of members of other species. I don't know why you want for it not to be a thing; it is ***literally*** the basis of your own arguments here for why killing non-human-animals is somehow reasonable or defensible.

Criticising a politician for attending a certain school, studying a certain degree or having had a certain job is utterly ridiculous. Judge them on what they do and say - not on their background.

And both sides are equally guilty of presenting predictions of the future as if they're fact, when actually they're just opinions based on disputed logic.

&gt; Just look at the message. The 6th largest economy in the world couldn't function outside of the EU.

I don't think anyone has ever said that. I think what they actually say is that they believe the UK functions and trades better inside the EU than outside. Whether or not that's true is up for debate, but this is a prime example of both sides presenting opposing conclusions as if they were fact.

&gt; If you agree with that I think you are a loser. That's the kind of mentality that holds this nation back.

That's very mature of you.

&gt; They are going to make it about the economy and benefits.

&gt; Instead of addressing our border issues and immigration. They are going to talk about petty savings in benefits.

For many people, this is their primary concern. That's not to say that they may not care about other issues (like immigration) at all - just that their overriding priority is the economy. But that's just not the correct opinion to have, is it?

&gt; They are going to try and convince people that our economy would crash because we would cease trading with the EU.

No, they're not - not anyone worth listening to anyway. But they *will* try to convince people that the UK economy is better served inside the EU that out of it, as the other side will do the opposite.

&gt; Time and time again, the ones saying that the EU needs to change and we need to claw back powers as part of the negotiation. When pressed if we got nothing would they vote to leave they say they would still vote to remain. What kind of loser mentality is that.

Hopefully this new problem emerging from the Mediterranean will show that we need to put our ideological opinions aside and work together with EU nations to come to unified agreement on how to stop these issues, and potentially as ""New"" European Neighborhood policy in order to respond to the threat of failed states on the border Europe.

"Thanks for the link; I hadn't seen all the details. I don't think he demonstrated that the current pensions are unsustainable though. 

If they are unsustainable then we shouldn't really be starting from here. Pensions should have been cut back for new entrants some time ago. But given  that we *are* starting from here, the retirement deal should be honoured in its entirety and we need to be changing the rules for new employees only.

I wonder if public sector pensions have been used in the same way as PFI. It's allowed previous governments to recruit large numbers of public sector employees on a low salary, and pass the bulk of the cost to future governments and future generations. (In the private sector GM in the US did much the same thing with its workforce...)

So how come PFI payments are sacrosanct but public sector pensions can be axed?

About GM again Im not an expert or anything and I'll take your word on Scandinavia and drought prone countries but it seems not all that much different from traditional hybridisation. I'm not sure it has the revolutionary potential that has been given to it, its mostly used to increase crop yields through killing pests and such.

"Well, you haven't actually addressed a single point I raised. You've just written some vague sounding words.

&gt; Every country in the world effected by the financial crisis, as a consequence of greed and incompetence of major corporations and banks, has had its deficit increased in dealing with the action necessary to prevent an international collapse of world's financial systems.

The deficit has not *been* increased. It has proportionally increased due to the recession. Some countries have been able to spend their way out of recession - see my point above about Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands - but thanks to Labours mismanagement, the UK is not in this happy position.  

&gt; I never claimed the deficit doesn't need to be dealt with.

Well, you strongly implied that the statement ""We must deal with the deficit! We're all in this together!"" was rhetoric rather than fact.

&gt; It's just a matter of fact the government's agenda is nothing but counterproductive to the national economy and society as a whole.

No, this is not a matter of fact, this is hyperbole. 

Now, let's check that link. Hmm, some very dubious citations there...

- Martin Wolf proposes more borrowing (not surprising for a man who has spearheaded the Keynesian resurgence) but chiefly calls for greater collaboration between Government and central banks (not surprising for a former IMF head).

- In his article, Samuel Brittan simply makes the point that the proportion of deficit is a variable (which is true).

- The full report by Victoria Chick is interesting. Like some of the other Keynesians, she advocates borrowing, but neglect to say where the money will come from. It can't come from any domestic bank without creating credit from nothing (which she opposes), so then where? Bear in mind that the one time that Britain had to go cap in hand to the IMF, we had to implement much harsher cuts than the ones we're facing now. Plus we'd risk losing that AAA credit rating, and then we'd really be up shit creek.

These are just the articles that I could be bothered to check fully - beware of sources that simply list quotes without any context. 

That website notes that ""The crash was caused when a finance bubble turned out to be an illusion.""

This is true and it's the structural deficit that was built on this bubble that needs to be addressed. However it claims that we need to wait until the recession is passed before making cuts. This is a ludicrous statement - since we need the cash tied up in this structural deficit to stimulate the economy. 

The entire proposal behind FalseEconomy.org (which is really just another branch of March for the Alternative, which is in turn another TUC front) is that the private sector should continue to roll in public money while the private sector dwindles and dies from overtaxation and neglect. That's not a viable future.

Just because you have a refrigerator and an ipad doesn't mean you've been getting wealthier.

This is why inequality is important: because your contentment and happiness in life -- your ... quality of life... is measured relative to your *contemporary* standards. In which case, actually, *yes* growing inequality *does* mean that your quality of life is going down.

&gt;That isn't an economic issue, it is a political issue.

So, hypothetically, if we, as a society, decide that everyone who earns more than $100k/yr should be sacrificed to appease the goddess of Economy and bring more money rains... would that be a political issue with absolutely no economic effects whatsoever?

"Well my cat decided to jump on top of my keyboard and screw up everything I wrote, so here's my well-thought out reply in short:

I agree that Democrat presidents seem to listen to their advisers more.  I am not sure why that is.  Perhaps because Republicans have certain principles that economics can't shake but a Nixon goes to China event can, while Democrats don't actually have any set of principles, but just like the concept of certain things and follow the policy advice of economists to achieve those ends.  

That being said, I highly doubt Democratic senators are the same way.  In fact, if you look at your own CNN link:

&gt;Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, D-South Dakota, called Mankiw's comments ""Alice in Wonderland economics.""

or
 
&gt;""The president's economic report is an insult to every hard-working American. It's **unpatriotic economics**, and he should apologize for it,"" said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, at the same briefing.

"&gt; When I withdraw $100 from my savings account, the bank would have to either pull $100 from its reserves or borrow it, right? So how is my consumption not exactly offset by what the bank does?

We can keep walking through the balance sheet example to illustrate that:

Customer balance sheet

||Assets|Liabilities and equity|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Savings deposit|100||
|Deposit withdrawal|-100 bank deposit||
||+100 currency|
|*totals:*|100||

Bank balance sheet

||Assets|Liabilities and equity|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Savings deposit||100|
|Reserves|10||
|Deposit withdrawal||-100 bank deposit|
||+90 reserves|+90 short term borrowings|
||-100 reserves||
|*totals:*|0|100|

The bank uses its reserves for settlement of deposit transactions. To settle your withdrawal transaction, the bank draws down on its existing reserves and where necessary borrows additional reserves from other banks or from the central bank. At the end of the process, you have swapped a bank deposit asset for a physical currency asset and the bank has swapped a deposit liability for a short term borrowing liability.

This also leads to an answer for another question: why banks want your deposit business. As you see, settlement of a deposit transaction results in a transfer of reserves. This is the least expensive way for a bank to acquire reserves from other banks. Borrowing them from other banks is a little more costly. Borrowing them from the central bank is the most expensive.

But if it violates even the most basic theoretical premises of democracy, i.e. it's shifting the CDF of political power non-linear and non-equal, then it's not exactly democracy as the theory is traditionally understood (nor as it was understood by Arrow).  They explicitly mention that they violate Arrow's cardinality assumption as well in their paper.

Were I sitting in this presentation, I'd ask the question, ""Why not a dictatorship?""  And I'd be curious to hear the answer.  Because it is another solution for what they are attempting to achieve - a violation of democratic pre-conditions to circumvent the impossibility theorem in favor of pareto efficient rank-ordering of social choices.

I simply can't see how you can disagree with this:
1. The cumulative distribution function of political power shifts between standard democracy and this model such that it is a proportional to wealth.
2. Arrow's cardinality assumption is violated in this model.
3. The authors do this hoping to achieve Pareto Efficiency.
4. Arrow proved one can achieve Pareto Efficiency in a dictatorship.

At least those should not be points of contention or disagreement.

The only step I'm taking that one might think is at all controversial is to say, ""If you value pareto efficiency in rank-order social choices where there are more than 2 choices more than you value the definitional preconditions of democracy, then why not simply propose the dictatorship solution?""

But I think it's a fair question.  Now, they might think this system is somehow fairer or safer or otherwise more useful than a dictatorship.  But it is certainly more convoluted.  

Regardless, the I still cannot fathom how you can possibly disagree with the 4 enumerated points here.  There's factual.  Not open for debate.",,0,cqy5mii,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Oh, I see. A government deficit would create some extra money for the economy, while the people who are owed the money of the deficit feel confident it will be repaid at some point in the future and will not change their spending. Hence inflation. But you expect those deficits to be paid back at some point, right? (ie in times of boom, which would shrink the ""deficit monetary expansion"" back to previous size, since the gov needs to get the money from somewhere, and therefore would once again acount nothing for long-term inflation).

But what if the deficit continues to grow? Let's just account for that possibility, that even in times of boom the government wouldn't manage to repay its debts. Now because the Fed has this policy of buying up gov bonds regardless of expectancy of seeing them repaid, bankers will just continue to lend the government money. 

But at some point, if this continues, there'll be a surplus of bonds that the Fed can't get rid of. The bankers will effectively have gotten money for worthless bonds, and as the bonds sit uselessly with the Fed, it'll constitute default. Only now the extra money of this inflation won't have gone only to the government, its advantages will also have applied to the bankers to some degree, through the process of selling and rebuying them at good prices. And the default is insidious, for it relies on bonds slowly losing value.

&gt;The __velocity of money__ (also called the __velocity of circulation of money__) refers to how fast money passes from one holder to the next. It can refer to the __income velocity of money__, which is the [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) at which the average unit of currency is used to purchase newly domestically-produced goods and services within a given time period.  In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time.  Alternatively and less frequently, it can refer to the __transactions velocity of money__, which is the frequency with which the average unit of currency is used in any kind of transaction in which it changes possession—not only the purchase of newly produced goods, but also the purchase of financial assets and other items.

 [**Negative income tax**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative%20income%20tax): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;In [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics), a __negative income tax__ (__NIT__) is a [progressive income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_income_tax) system where people earning below a certain amount receive supplemental pay from the government instead of paying taxes to the government. Such a system has been discussed by economists but never fully implemented. It was developed by [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people) politician [Juliet Rhys-Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliet_Rhys-Williams) in the 1940s  and later by [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) economist [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman).   

&gt;Negative income taxes can implement a [basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) or supplement a [guaranteed minimum income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_minimum_income) system.

&gt;In a negative income tax system, people earning a certain income level would owe no taxes; those earning more than that would pay a proportion of their income above that level; and those below that level would receive a payment of a proportion of their shortfall, which is the amount their income falls below that level.

For large urban centres, making use of waste for heating makes sense. For rural zones, masonry heaters make sense. 

By easing regulations to European standards, we can bring the cost of masonry heaters in-line with existing heating systems. If we dedicated some funding to technical colleges, opened up licenses in the brick industry, encouraged development of dedicated equipment, then the cost would be far lower. 

Masonry heaters have been tested for hundreds of years and in every region in Canada. Their life expectancy is limited to the buildings. They are closed, highly efficient, producing little waste to clean up, requiring a single firing a day, and can save thousands of dollars per year on heating costs.

And for these reasons, ""sustainability officers"" and government will not discuss them. This is the issue. More than all the BS that goes into the ideology of ""CAGW"", is the chosen responses: provide government with more power to carry out an agenda.

"Fake news are an outrageous issue, I agree with you.

The strategic petroleum reserve could get chipped off by a small percentage each year. If you have an economy that is fossil fuel independent you don't need a petroleum reserve. Is it hard to achieve? Yes, but it's necessary.

Low income households could get environmentally responsible options. For instance, top of the pop isolation, solar where possible or wood fueled thermostats.

If tax and oil companies don't have the possibility to depreciate like any other company, prices go up. Then you can enjoy watching how fast new, cheaper options pop up.

Unfortunately, it's a zero sum game. Either we find a way to remain under 1.5 degrees of global warming (whether you believe or not that it is human caused) or else we're pretty fucked. And not killing off fossil fuel companies is already hindering the process. To at the very least stop cuddling with them would be pretty fucking nice.

"We would really need distributed generation and a smart grid.  You lose a lot of energy transporting it from far away. We have to do this because the ways we produce energy are dangerouse to have near residential areas. We have the technology to make our thermostats turn off when we are not home. We have buliding materials that reflect or absorb heat more efficiently, hell painting a house a darker color in the north and a lighter color in the south would help.  Heres the problem with gdp, hte best thing for gdp is for us to be wastefull.  Its not measuring quality of life its measuring how much stuff we need to make and spend each year. theoretically if we made long lasting high quality products gdp might go down because people wouldnt need to buy as much.  We could live in cheaper smaller houses, drive cheaper smaller cars and have cheaper shorter commutes. All of this would look bad on paper because people aren't spending money and taking out as big of loans.  Insulating your house saves you money in the long term. Gdp would be lower if had less money but quality of life would not be lower if we needed less money.  The transportation sector is a classic case of waste.  We should be shipping more things as train freight and not as truck freight.  We should activly ecourage more liveable walkable cities and actively discourage suburban sprawl.

St paul heats all of downtown together rather than each building seperatly. It runs on sustainable biomass gathered from at least 60m or closer.  Is saves a hell of a lot of money and the electricity it creates is cheaper than the electricity they were producing in the 80s (adjusted for inflation).     If you are determined to decide that either its impossible or not worth doing then thats how you will see it. I am certain that we as a society can do this and that we need to do this from a moral standpoint.  We spent $425 billion (adjusted for inflation) on the US interstate system because we felt it was needed for our countries future. We could insulate 170 million homes ($2500 a home)  We could do allsorts of stuff.  It would take about 30 trillion dollars to switch the entire world to renewable energy at todays consumption and the rate of increase. Thats 1/5 of the worlds gdp.

"Woah, thanks james_joyce for this earnest, documented, response. For sure, on my side, I was venting.  Overall, I agree that using insults does not move forward human understanding - yet once in a while, I'm still quite happy to be blunt, just because it feels good, that's all, especially when targetting people who got brainwashed into believing that free-market capitalism is the best ever possible system for human beings on this planet.  And if you identify with this description, I trust you can take an insult, you guys basicly still dominate all the major global institutions nowadays, in spite of the ongoing deep crisis of the system you put in place.

In complement, yeah, I'm also all for promoting open respectful dialogue and debate about any hypothesis.  That being said, in many fora and places, including notably among economics, free-market capitalism is all-too-often presented as a unquestionable paradigm, the best way to maximise utility for everyone, period. And questioning such assumptions becomes impossible (including for instance the very idea that our basic purpose as living human beings is to maximise utility, a concept that was well challenged by Marcel Mauss, for instance, who noticed via early anthropological research that giving was far more conducive of human cohesion in social groups than having individuals hoard ressources...).

Regarding the minimum wage, I'd be curious to read the 50+ years of studies you mention that suggest that minimum wage laws make things worse (for whom? and on what measures? and yeah, who promoted such studies?).

But if most people are doing okay, and some people are ""doing better"" is it a bad thing that some have managed to do really well?

Here's the [official data on poverty](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2018/09/poverty-rate-drops-third-consecutive-year-2017.html)  As you can see, poverty rates have been under 15% for 50 years.  They aren't getting any worse (although, one can argue they aren't better, either).  Except that in the 1950s, that glorious time when everything was wonderful, poverty rates were higher.  In the 1940s, of course, they were crushingly bad, and in the 1930s (Great Depression), they were bad enough to cause mass suicides.  

In 1960, poverty rates for minorities were around 50%.  Now they are just slightly higher than the national average.  The South is where the poverty rates are highest, and the mid-west has the lowest average poverty.  But, regionally, all regions fit pretty well within the just below 12% to just above 15% range.

1) The author actually says he's hyperventiilating.

But he isn't really speaking for all Bay Area residents.  There are some of us who simply believe in having a conversation about this without blowing into a bag or claiming that things are being ""destroyed"" (reminds me of the old chicken little thing).

Yes.  ""Portland.""

I think one of the best features (maybe a not-so-good feature as well) of these new possible company structures is people can return to living in the country, in the hinterlands - in the middle west.

So this ""explosion"" that the author claims to be afraid of is actually a welcome relief in many ways.  Telecommuting from the Ozarks or Roswell or Prescott would bring a welcome relief to urban overcrowding and probably ease the real estate market.

"First, I think this is a very good sub.  It provides a resource list as does econmonitor.  If people would consider coming here with an economic point of view and using the listed resources instead of coming here to express only a political sentiment I think it would improve.

The moderators here have been quite supportive of maintaining an economic point of view in my experience.   Thanks to them for that. 

I think the goals of the sub make sense.  I think the moderation rules are just slightly overly complex and ought to exist to support the goals of the sub. 

Here are the first two rules:

&gt;/r/Economics concerns proliferation and discourse pertaining to research, news, academic work, and academic summaries from the perspective of economists.

&gt;Submissions tenuously related to economics, light on economic analysis, or from perspectives other than those of economists will be removed.

We learn in economics that we have freedom to make choices.  Within these goals we ought to have the freedom to support the goals in the best way we can choose, in general, as long as we're being accurate and honest.

So for this third rule below about submissions, the economic way would be to have the phrase beginning with ""with..""   to be taken to mean ""including"" as long as what else we include conforms to accuracy, honesty, and other goals of the sub:


&gt;Submissions must be from original sources with original headlines. Memes, self-promotion and low-quality blogs are not acceptable. Source spamming is not acceptable. Further Explanation.

That is I would say the phrase ""with original headlines"" should be taken to mean that, as long as the original headline is included WITH the title that any actual content (not editorialized) which ACCURATELY represents the article and promotes rules 1, 2 and other rules should be allowed to accompany the headline.

The question I have is, if we include actual representative content (related to economics) does it promote economic discussion? Does it  increase the amount of discussion?

To that end I am running a kind of ""Pareto Efficiency"" experiment to determine which method best promotes economics:

1) Headline alone in /r/economics, or 

2) Headline + actual text related to economics in /r/economy 

The metric for  the largest  audience will be measured by the most ""voting views"" (up votes or down votes, not just upvotes) plus comments. 

I would suggest others try this as well.  My results so far:

 
- ""ABC’s of Business Cycle Theory: Beyond Keynes vs. Hayek"" had 9 voting views in /r/economy 

- ""ABC’s of Business Cycle Theory"" (with no actual text) got only 2 to  4 voting view (it reports 75% upvotes resulting in a total of 2.  I don't know what integer is 4/3 of 2 but it must be somewhere between 2 and 4).


But /r/economy is a smaller sub with only 1/4th the population.  Thus, adding one actual line that showed the economic relevance added views in a smaller sub.

To some degree it depends on when the post is submitted.  I have submitted these at the same time.  However there is no way to tell whether reddit use is at the same times of a week for both subs.

"First of all, you're correct, I meant to write social mobility is lower, not higher. My mistake.

Secondly, you seem to be getting pretty wound up here, it's just a discussion, getting aggressive doesn't tend to lead to a very productive conversation.

Thirdly, I do understand economics, and I'm also willing to listen to a variety of arguments. Like I said, there's a strong argument that the crisis was caused by increasing income (or wealth inequality), as there is for the 1929 crisis. That doesn't mean that there are no other arguments, or even that the other arguments aren't strong.

The fact of the matter is no one can completely explain why the crisis happened, it's a pretty complex subject. When you state that inequality doesn't cause recessions (and there is an argument that what we have been seeing since 2007-08 is a crisis, not just a temporary recession which we are long done with), you can't demonstrate that, because no one can.

I'd be quite interested in discussing the issues that caused the crisis with you, as you seem quite opinionated. Could you please expand on what caused the recession starting in 2007-08?

Just to give you some material to look into, and obviously it's just an academic paper, it doesn't provide any definitive proof, the article below shows a framework within which inequality can create crises.

Proof? The democratic party didn't exist until 1828 and the republicans didn't come along until 1854.

I'm okay with this. Sociopolitically China hasn't been a good trading partner. I'd rather the US corporations have their supply chains in friendly nations for a few pennies more.

* provides 90% of the trade revenue which funds North Korea's nuclear weapons development
* manipulates their currency to maintain export supremacy
* dumps goods on the free market to wipe out other nations industries
* has protectionist policies against US manufacturers
* steals IP and other corporate secrets
* wants to remove independence from allied nations like Taiwan
* creates and increasingly liberty reducing police states for their citizens

"&gt;I am a tall man. And when I read online how much harder it is for short men to find girlfriends, I realize I have an entirely undeserved privilege. If we have mutual interest in each other with a woman I will still not back off just because it is not fair to short men to be succesful with women as a tall man. And obviously I will not support redistributing my height with a chainsaw. It is simply just life, and if this rather inspires the short men to up their fitness and talk, everybody wins by that.

Your height isn't transferable.

Your wealth is.

And while it is demotivating to take other peoples stuff - this only matters if they are the producer of that stuff. A man who inherits his wealth didn't make it and so his motivation doesn't matter.

Btw, we don't need the state at all for any of this - it can simply be a generally held social rule that very rich people don't pass on their wealth.",,0,czw0qo0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Wow, what an amazingly clever and succinct fucking comic. You’ve totally changed my point of view!

I’m also really glad that you *know* my beliefs are based on whatever benefits me most personally. I didn’t realize you knew who I was! It’s possible for people to have standards and ideas that don’t necessarily directly benefit them.

Also: the point I’m making is that everyone should be able to bargain! Employers have the ability to bargain because they have the capital.

One question: If we agree that the wealthy save a larger proportion of their income, reducing inequality will increase nominal short-term AD, all other things being equal, correct? Increases in demand can, in the short term, reactivate sluggish economic growth in a virtuous cycle, if Keynes is to be believed. So could we currently be experiencing sub-optimal short-term growth due to the misallocation of resources that would be better off in the hand of people who will spend them?

Even if we focus on long-term growth only, the question remains whether allowing inequality to continue increasing is defensible. As long as we're talking about democratic market economies, studies don't seem to correlate rising inequality with superior growth. The IMF in fact did [**a study**](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2014/sdn1402.pdf) that actually showed that historically, extremely unequal economies tended to experience worse long-term growth than fairer societies, and that moderate taxative redistribution showed no correlation with sluggish growth.

"I don't disagree with either ideal. In fact, I think it's a rarely candid moment on the part of scientists to recognize that the public doesn't trust them anymore. Unfortunately, a march is not going to help. In fact, it might hurt. In my opinion, if they really want to rebuild trust in science, they need to identify real solutions to the problem. Some of these might include:

- Examination of perverse incentives in science.

- For every major study, equal funding for a Red Team counterstudy.

- How the hell they are going to deal with the replication crisis. One approach might be to create an incentive system to attempt honest replication and move those papers that can't replicate previous studies to the front of the publishing line.

- Addressing the institutional pressure towards groupthink.

- How to reward those who speak out against groupthink.

- Drawing a clear line between scientist and activist. Recognizing that one cannot be both and maintain the required emotional disconnect to actually produce science.

- Creating boards of ethics that censure those putting their thumbs on the scales, as it were, and/or those who are seen to apply peer pressure towards conformity of thinking.

- The various scientific bodies need to stop acting like political organizations. The APS's statement on climate change is a great example of what not to do.

- The various scientific bodies need to police themselves for activists that would speak for the body as a whole.

"**The NDP** generally believes that Canadian society mistreats workers and the lower class. They favor government spending and trade protection to avoid loss of jobs to overseas business. On Foreign policy they are generally critical of US foreign policy advocating diplomacy and support for controversial issues such as criticism of Israeli war crimes. In the past they have supported Cap and Trade as a means of controlling CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions to tackle climate change although they oppose a carbon tax for the projected negative effects it would have on lower and working classes.

**The Conservatives** generally believe that Canadian society has become too socially permissible and at times coddles people making them into dependents of the state. They favor restrained government involvement in the economy and tougher penalties for crime. Tax cuts for business and individuals so they argue creates jobs for people willing to work. They favor stronger regional power for provinces over a centralized federal system and currently are attempting to reform the senate into an elected body. In foreign policy they tend to adopt US conservative foreign policy and supported the Iraq war. Recently they have stepped back from multilateral initiatives in development in order to focus on Latin America over Asia and Africa. On the issue of climate change they have previously been doubtful about its' veracity and abandoned Kyoto emissions targets signed into law. They have stated that Canada will adopt whatever cap and trade legislation is passed in the US so as to keep the two economies integrated and continue to invest in carbon capture and sequestration technology for the Alberta Tar Sands.

**The Liberal Party** tends to waver between the other two parties shifting in favor of particular viewpoints as the populace supports them. Currently they support mandatory minimum sentencing for violent crime as the conservatives do but also argue for greater government stimulus financed by stopping scheduled corporate tax cuts. They believe in centralized government at the Federal level as a means to equalize living standards between different geographic regions and oppose separatist elements particularly within Quebec. In Foreign policy they supported the war in Afghanistan but not Iraq (although their current leader supported it at the time). Their stance on International relations tends to favor multilateral relations and diplomacy over use of force and isolationism. In the past they opposed NAFTA's free trade proposals although since the 90s have embraced free trade as a means of economic growth. During the last election cycle the Liberals proposed a carbon tax to be phased in over a decade as a means of meeting Canadian commitments to Kyoto. Their loss and subsequent change in leadership has left the question open as to where they stand today on tackling climate change.

**The Progressive party** is a political party that is no longer involved in Canadian politics. The Federal *Green Party* is perhaps the closest corrallary to present day. On social issues they are in favor of greater personal freedoms favoring legalization of marijuana and have campaigned for a guaranteed minimum income as a means of relieving poverty. Fiscally they argue shifting the tax base from incomes to polluting actions will increase economic growth by stimulating consumption and reducing waste from heavily subsidized oil and gas industries while creating incentives for individuals to reduce waste. Money gathered from carbon shifting is to be used to fund research and social programs. On foreign policy they tend to copy the NDP policy arguing for an immediate military withdrawl and the establishment of a UN peacekeeping force in Afghanistan. On climate change they support both Cap and Trade as well as Carbon tax for methods in reducing Canada's CO2 emissions.

You may occasionally see comparisons to US or other political movements but the right/left distinction has grown murkier since the late 90s.

Just like gambling, its not a problem until you lose. I've never heard of anyone going to Gamblers Anonymous because they won too much in Vegas.
&gt;
&gt;Well now the market crapped out, &amp; even though it has come back somewhat, the government and the average Joes are still looking for a scapegoat. God knows there has to beone for everything. Well, here we are. 

&gt;Go ahead and continue to take us down, but you're only going to hurt yourselves. What's going to happen when we cant find jobs on the Street anymore? Guess what: We're going to talk yours. We get up at 5am &amp; work till 10pm or later. We're used to not getting up to pee when we have a position. We don't take an hour or more for lunch break. We don't demand a union. We don't retire at 50 with a pension. We eat what we kill, and when the only thing left to eat is on your dinner plate, we'll eat that.

&gt;For years teahcers and other unionized labor have had us fooled. We were to busy working to notice. Do you really think that er are incapable of teaching 3rd graders and doing landscaping? We're going to take your cushy jobs with tenure and 4 months off a year and whine just like you, that we are so-o-o-o underpaid for building the future youth of America. Say goodbye to you overtime and double time and a half I'll be hitting grounders to the highschool baseball team for $5k extra a summer, thank you very much. So now that we're going to be making $85k a year without upside, Joe Mainstreet is going to have revenge, right? Wrong! Guess what: we're going to stop buying the new 80k car , we aren't going to leave the 35 percent tip at our buisness dinners anymore. No more free rides on our backs. We're going to landscape our own back yards, wash our cars with a garden hose in our driveways. Our money was your money. You spent it. When our money dries up, so does yours. 
&gt;The difference is, you lived off of it, we rejoiced in it. The Obama administration and the Democratic National Commintte might get their way and knock us off the top of the pyramid, but it's realling going to hurt like hell for them when our fat a**es land directly on the middle class of America and knock them to the bottom.

"I certainly agree with you. Also, conservative economic thought is more sophisticated overall. I'm not talking about the rhetoric Republican politicians will use to argue for extending tax rates for everyone, but in general a limited government and federalist philosophy isn't as easy to attack on principle. Intelligent people who argue we should have Constitutionally limited government and, for example, abolish all Federal welfare &amp; entitlement programs and instead allow States to craft their own unique welfare programs, if they choose, in a manner that is best adapted to the unique and special needs of each individual State, aren't that easy to attack. Rather than one national Medicaid, or food stamp program, or SS or Medicare or other social spending programs, I think if we abolished these and drastically lowered Federal tax rates, then States could establish their own programs and I think we'd be much better off. Moreover, these programs in the State level should be paid for through sales tax, rather than income tax, so that everyone is truly contributing and it doesn't involve direct plundering and wealth transfers.

Just as an example, I think a nuanced policy position like the one I just stated is much harder to attack than to just say ""Rick Santorum is crazy and wants to ban porn!! LOL!!""
