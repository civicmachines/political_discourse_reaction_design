    Spam will always be removed. Spam is defined as off topic posts (far off topic), solicitations, excessive posting of a single idea to get attention. Spam and spammers will be removed immediately without consultation with each other, and the action will be noted in the mod queue. People who feel they are wrongly banned for this may make their case by sending a message (click on the letter and then Compose) to #MensRights. If you find spam, please send a link of it to the modqueue

    Revealing personal information about another user will result in an immediate removal of the information and likely of the user. This has been addressed by hueypriest in the main reddit Added: Additionally, this includes home address data for damn near everybody.

    Personal attacks against other commenters and the mods generally do not contribute to conversations, and may result in some kind of disciplinary action. In cases where a mod is involved in the conversation and feels actions is necessary, the mod will put a message in the mod queue and the other mod (who is not involved) will determine whether a ban is warranted. The ban may be temporary, as a way of cooling all parties down, and the user will be messaged as such. IF the issue gets serious enough, and the user continues to berate and insult, and the other mod is not available in a reasonable amount of time, the involved mod will implement a banning and then discuss it with the other mod.

    In general, we are going to direct any and all mod requests to the mod queue, and suggest users do the same. Messages about moderation sent in private to one mod will be replied with a request to send it to the mod queue (compose a private message to #MensRights rather than to one of our names).

    Advocacy of child porn cannot be tolerated. It is morally repugnant and socially indefensible. There is room for discussion about the over-reach of certain laws, and controversies, such as the intersection of cp laws and TSA screening of children, but none of us advocates or would want to be seen as advocating the abuse of children for any reason, including sexual gratification, either directly or through the trade of images involving children. Images of pedobear are not welcome here. Report them and they will be removed. If you should ever see cp images posted here, report it directly to law enforcement.

    Actually Include an Opinion
    Not a link to some article or just give raw facts. Please state a real opinion and make sure it's in the post, not the comments.

    Search before submitting Duplicate posts will be removed on sight as they clutter the sub.

    No Trolling
    This isn't the place for it. Any clear troll posts and comments will be removed.

    No Spam

    Be Civil
    Remember: You're humans, not animals. You have an intelligent brain, respect other people's intelligent brains. Any insults or personal anger with one another will simply be removed. This is a subreddit of open debates, not Xbox Live.

    Must be an unpopular opinion
    This means it's controversial, the majority of Reddit disagree with it, uncommon and may appear offensive to some.

    Elaborate
    Why do you feel this way about your unpopular opinion? You MUST give a sophisticated explanation to support your opinion, otherwise it will be removed. Elaborating and supporting your opinion opens an opportunity in discussion! It's also a good idea to add any facts, figures or statistics to your opinion to give it the extra power. However, you will not be punished if you don't use any facts.

    No Memes
    If you have any confession bear memes, please submit those to /r/DucksAndBears.

    Hate posts are not allowed
    There's a fine line between a hate post and an unpopular opinion. Hostile, rude and aggressive behaviour is not a necessity to express your opinion. Please be civil and and have respect.

    Structure your opinion correctly
    The protagonist disease. If you don't like X, that means X is bad. If you like X, that means X is good. FALSE. When expressing a subjective opinion, If you don't like X, don't translate your opinion of disliking X to a fact of X is bad. X isn't bad. You just don't like it. There's a fine line. ""X is terrible"" to ""I don't like X"".
    This isn't a ban-able offence, but please make sure you say your opinion correctly.
